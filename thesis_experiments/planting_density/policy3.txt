1. Activate the robot's observation mode using the RGB cameras to identify the target location marked as 'concrete area'.
2. Guide the robot to navigate towards the identified 'concrete area' using GPS and lidar-inertial odometry for precise localization.
3. Once the robot reaches the 'concrete area', set the planting pattern to 'grid' with a 'pattern_offset' of 1 meter, as given in the constraint_dictionary. 
4. Begin planting seeds according to the defined grid pattern. The robot should plant a seed, move 1 meter along the X axis, plant another seed, and repeat this process until it reaches the end of the 'concrete area'.
5. After reaching the end of the 'concrete area' along the X axis, the robot should move 1 meter along the Y axis and start planting seeds again, moving back along the X axis. Repeat this pattern until the entire 'concrete area' is covered in the defined grid pattern.
6. During the entire process, continuously update the system memory with the GPS coordinates of each planted location as the 'seed' boolean is set to True.
7. Once all the seeds are planted, guide the robot to navigate back to the starting point using lidar-inertial odometry and GPS.
8. Notify the user that the task has been successfully completed and provide the total count and locations of the planted seeds from the system memory.
