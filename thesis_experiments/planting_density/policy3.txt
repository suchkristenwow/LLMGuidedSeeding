1. Navigate to the predefined rangeland plot starting point.
2. Activate RGB cameras and lidar-inertial odometry system for localization and identification of the 'concrete area' as per the 'goal_lms' from the constraint dictionary.
3. Upon detecting the 'concrete area', begin planning the 'grid' pattern as per the 'pattern' from the constraint dictionary with 'pattern_offset' of 1m x 1m. This refers to the spacing between each planting spot.
4. Initialize the planting process: 
   - 4.1. Activate the seed planting mechanism.
   - 4.2. Plant the first seed at the initial point of the 'concrete area'.
   - 4.3. Store the planted location in system memory.
5. Navigate 1 meter (as per 'pattern_offset') away from the initial point along the planned grid path.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the end of the row is reached.
7. At the end of the row, navigate 1 meter (as per 'pattern_offset') perpendicular to the previous row and begin the next row from step 4.
8. Continue this process until the entire 'concrete area' is covered, avoiding any obstacles if detected and making sure each seed is planted 1 meter away from the others in a grid pattern.
9. Upon completion, verify all the planted locations stored in the system memory to ensure the planting task has been executed as per the desired density.
10. If the task is completed successfully, send a task completion notification to the human operator. If not, identify the areas that were missed or incorrectly planted and repeat the relevant steps.
11. Return to the starting point after the task is fully completed.
