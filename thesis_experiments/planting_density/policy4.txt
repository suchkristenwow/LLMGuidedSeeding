1. Initialize the location memory list to keep track of all the planted locations, given the 'seed' boolean is True.
2. Utilize the robot's RGB cameras and lidar-inertial odometry to identify and locate the 'concrete area', which is the goal landmark as per the constraint dictionary.
3. Once the 'concrete area' is identified, use GPS to fix the exact coordinates of this area. 
4. Start with the south-west most point of the concrete area (considering North as up) and mark it as the starting point.
5. Move to the starting point using the robot's autonomous navigation system.
6. Plant the first seed at the starting point and add this location to the location memory list.
7. Now, form a grid pattern as per the 'pattern_offset' defined in the constraint dictionary. In this case, it's 1 meter.
8. Start moving in the east direction from the starting point, maintaining a distance of 1 meter between each point as per the grid pattern.
9. At each point, stop and plant a seed. Add the coordinates of each of these points to the location memory list.
10. Continue this process until the end of the concrete area is reached in the east direction.
11. Once the end is reached, move north by 1 meter from the last planted point and start moving west, repeating the seed planting process.
12. Alternate between east and west direction after each row (1 meter apart), and repeat the process until the entire concrete area is covered by the grid.
13. The task is complete when all the points in the grid pattern over the concrete area have a seed planted.
14. For the robot's safety and to avoid damaging the newly planted seeds, carefully navigate the robot out of the concrete area using the most direct path to the nearest edge.
15. Maintain the location memory list in the system memory for future reference and further tasks if needed.
