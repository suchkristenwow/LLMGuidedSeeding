1. Activate the RGB cameras and lidar-inertial odometry system to start observation of the environment.
2. Use GPS for initial localization and orientation.
3. Search and identify the 'concrete area' as defined in the 'goal_lms' of the constraint dictionary using the RGB cameras.
4. Navigate towards the identified 'concrete area'.
5. Upon reaching the 'concrete area', initiate the planting process. 
6. Check the 'pattern' parameter from the constraint dictionary which is 'grid' in this case.
7. Begin the planting process on a grid pattern with 'pattern_offset' of 1m as specified in the constraint dictionary.
8. Plant a seed at the current location and store the coordinates of this location in the system memory.
9. Move 1m to the right, plant a seed, and store the new location in the system memory.
10. Repeat step 9 until the edge of the 'concrete area' is reached.
11. Upon reaching the edge, move 1m forward and plant a seed, store the new location in the system memory.
12. Move 1m to the left, plant a seed, and store the new location in the system memory.
13. Repeat step 12 until the other edge of the 'concrete area' is reached.
14. Continue alternating between steps 9-13 and steps 11-13, creating a grid pattern of planted seeds 1m apart until the entire 'concrete area' is covered.
15. Once the entire 'concrete area' is covered, stop the planting process.
16. Navigate back to the starting point or a designated location using GPS and stored coordinates.
17. End the task and switch off the RGB cameras and lidar-inertial odometry system.
