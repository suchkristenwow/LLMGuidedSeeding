# Step 1: Activate the robot's RGB camera and lidar-inertial odometry system to identify the surroundings.
# The hardware activation is assumed to be handled by the robot and does not need explicit code. 

# Step 2: Use the RGB camera to search for the 'concrete area'.
# This would be done using the get_all_objects() function and finding our target landmark.

# Step 3: Navigate to the 'concrete area'.

# Step 4: Check the 'seed' key in the policy. Since it's set to 'False', do not activate the seeding mechanism.
# No need for explicit code, as seeding mechanism will not be activated due to 'seed' key being False.

# Step 5 & 6: Plant in a 'grid' pattern with a density of 1m x 1m.
# Step 7: Begin by placing the robot at the first point in the grid.
# Step 8 & 9: Move in a straight line to the next point in the grid, 1 meter away, checking for any obstacles in the path.
# Step 10: Continue this process until the entire 'concrete area' has been covered in the specified grid pattern.
# Note: This function assumes a 2D grid (x,y) on a flat surface. If the grid needs to be 3D, the code would need adjustments.
