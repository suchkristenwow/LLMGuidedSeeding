1. Activate the RGB cameras and lidar-inertial odometry system for object detection and localization.
2. Start the navigation process to the 'goal_lms' which is the 'concrete area'. Use GPS to ensure the most accurate location tracking.
3. Once reached, scan the concrete area to get the size and shape for the grid planning.
4. Calculate the number of grid points needed based on the 'pattern_offset' which is 1 meter. This will provide us with the total grid points where seeds will be planted.
5. Begin at one corner of the concrete area, and prepare to plant the first seed.
6. Deploy the seed planting mechanism to plant the first seed.
7. Save the current location in system memory as a planted location.
8. Move 1 meter to the right (as per the 'pattern' and 'pattern_offset' from the constraint dictionary) to reach the next grid point.
9. Repeat steps 6-8 until you reach the end of the row.
10. At the end of the row, move 1 meter ahead and align yourself to start a new row of planting.
11. Repeat steps 6-10 until the entire concrete area is covered as per the 1m x 1m grid.
12. Once completed, perform a final scan to confirm all grid points have been seeded correctly.
13. If any grid points are missed, navigate to those points and plant seeds.
14. After confirming all points have been seeded, send a completion message to the user and go into standby mode.
