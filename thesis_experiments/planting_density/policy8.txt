1. Initiate the robot's navigational system and activate the RGB camera, GPS, and lidar-inertial odometry.
2. Direct the robot to locate the 'concrete area' goal landmark utilizing the RGB camera.
3. Once the 'concrete area' is identified, map out a grid pattern with a 'pattern_offset' of 1m x 1m using the GPS.
4. Start from one corner of the 'concrete area' and move towards the first grid point following the planned path.
5. At each grid intersection, check the 'seed' flag. As it is set to 'False' in this instance, the robot will not plant seeds.
6. Navigate to the next grid point following the shortest path.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until all grid points on the 'concrete area' have been covered.
8. Once the entire 'concrete area' is covered, stop the robot and signal task completion. 
9. Save the grid pattern and the visited grid points to the system memory for future reference. 
10. Return the robot to the starting point or to a designated 'safe' location.
