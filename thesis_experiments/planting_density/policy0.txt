1. Initialize the system and prepare for the task. Turn on all necessary sensors and ensure all systems are functioning properly.

2. Use the RGB cameras and lidar-inertial odometry to identify the plot boundaries and the concrete area. Update the internal map accordingly.

3. Utilize the GPS system for accurate positioning. The robot should confirm its current location and orient itself towards the concrete area.

4. Calculate the grid pattern with a 1m x 1m offset using the 'pattern_offset' value from the constraint dictionary.

5. Starting from one corner of the concrete area, navigate to the first grid point.

6. Once the robot has reached the first grid point, trigger the seed planting mechanism.

7. After planting a seed, save the coordinates of this location to the system memory.

8. Move to the next grid point by following the pre-calculated grid pattern.

9. Repeat steps 6 to 8 for each grid point within the concrete area. Ensure that the robot plants a seed and saves the location to system memory at each grid point.

10. If an obstacle is encountered, use the RGB cameras and lidar-inertial odometry to identify it. If it's on the 'avoid' list, remove the corresponding vertex in the planner graph and recalculate the route.

11. Once all grid points within the concrete area have been covered, cross-verify the planted locations list with the grid points to ensure all points have been seeded.

12. Finally, return to the starting position and update the status to "Task completed".

13. Report the final task status and the list of all planted locations to the user.
