1. Start by activating the robot's RGB cameras and lidar-inertial odometry for visualizing the environment and localizing itself.
2. Use the GPS to determine the initial location within the plot.
3. Enable the seed planting mechanism as the 'seed' boolean is True.
4. Begin by identifying the 'concrete' area which is the goal landmark as specified in the constraint dictionary.
5. After identifying the concrete area, utilize the robot's navigation system to guide it towards this area.
6. Once arrived at the concrete area, calculate the size of the area to determine the number of seeds to be planted based on the given density of 1m x 1m.
7. Start the seeding process by positioning the robot at one corner of the concrete area.
8. Plant the first seed at this corner. Record this location in the system memory as the first planted location.
9. From the initial seeding location, move the robot 1 meter horizontally (as defined by the 'pattern_offset' in the constraint dictionary) following the 'grid' pattern.
10. Plant the second seed at this new location and record this location in the system memory as the second planted location.
11. Repeat steps 9 and 10 until the robot reaches the end of the concrete area horizontally.
12. After reaching the end of the horizontal line, move the robot 1 meter vertically (as defined by the 'pattern_offset' in the constraint dictionary) and return it to the initial horizontal position.
13. Repeat steps 9 through 12 until the entire concrete area is covered and seeds are planted in a 1m x 1m grid pattern.
14. Once the entire area has been seeded, verify if all the locations where seeds have been planted are recorded in the system memory.
15. Upon completion of seeding, navigate the robot back to its starting position or the designated standby position.
16. Finally, update the task status as completed and provide a report including the number and locations of seeds planted and any obstacles encountered during the task.
