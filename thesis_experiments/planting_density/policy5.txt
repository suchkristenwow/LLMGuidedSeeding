1. Activate the robot's RGB cameras and GPS for observing landmarks and localization respectively.
2. Using the lidar-inertial odometry, calculate the current position of the robot.
3. Identify the 'concrete area' as the goal landmark using the RGB cameras. If the concrete area cannot be found, interface with the human for more direction or context.
4. Calculate a path to the 'concrete area' while avoiding any objects listed in the 'avoid' list. If a path cannot be found, interface with the human for more direction or context.
5. Navigate towards the 'concrete area' along the calculated path.
6. Once the robot is in the 'concrete area', calculate a grid pattern for planting the seeds with a density of 1m x 1m using the 'pattern_offset' value from the constraint dictionary.
7. Start at the first point of the calculated grid pattern.
8. Plant a seed at the current position and add the coordinates of the planted location to the system memory.
9. Move to the next point in the grid pattern.
10. Repeat steps 8 and 9 until all points in the grid pattern have been visited and seeds have been planted.
11. Once all seeds have been planted, navigate back to the starting point or a designated 'end' point.
12. Signal task completion and standby for further instructions.
