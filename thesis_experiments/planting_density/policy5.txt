1. Initialize the seeding system and make sure it's ready to perform the task.
2. Activate the robot's RGB cameras and lidar-inertial odometry for navigation and landmark detection.
3. Direct the robot to start localization using GPS data to find its position in the plot.
4. Program the robot to identify the 'concrete' landmarks using the RGB cameras.
5. Once the concrete area has been identified, set this as the goal landmark for the robot.
6. Activate the navigation system to guide the robot to the goal landmark. The navigation system should avoid any obstacles or features listed under "avoid" in the constraint dictionary. 
7. After reaching the concrete area, set the planting pattern as 'grid' with an offset of 1 meter as specified in the constraint dictionary.
8. Direct the robot to start planting seeds in the set grid pattern. The robot should make sure the distance between each planted seed is 1 meter in both directions (length and width) to maintain the desired density.
9. As each seed is planted, record the location in the system memory for future reference.
10. Continue the planting operation until the entire concrete area has been covered according to the grid pattern.
11. Once the planting task is completed, direct the robot to return to its starting location or a designated ending point.
12. Provide a summary of the task execution, including the number of seeds planted and the area covered.
13. Save the data of all planted locations in case it is needed for future tasks or analysis.
