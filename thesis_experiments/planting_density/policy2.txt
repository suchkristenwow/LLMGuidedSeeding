1. Activate the robot's RGB camera and lidar-inertial odometry system to identify the surroundings.
2. Use the RGB camera to search for the 'concrete area', which is defined as the goal landmark in the constraint dictionary.
3. Once the 'concrete area' is identified, use the robot's localization features to navigate towards it.
4. Check the 'seed' key in the constraint dictionary. Since it's set to 'False', do not activate the seeding mechanism.
5. Based on the 'pattern' key in the constraint dictionary, plant in a 'grid' pattern.
6. Use the 'pattern_offset' key to guide the grid pattern, ensuring a density of 1m x 1m. This means the robot will move in a pattern that resembles a grid, with each point of the grid being 1 meter apart from the other.
7. Begin by placing the robot at the first point in the grid. 
8. Move in a straight line to the next point in the grid, 1 meter away, checking for any obstacles in the path.
9. If an obstacle is detected, navigate around it and return to the correct grid path.
10. Continue this process until the entire 'concrete area' has been covered in the specified grid pattern.
11. If the robot encounters an object listed under "avoid", it will remove the corresponding vertex in the planner graph and safely navigate around it.
12. Once the task is completed, return the robot to the starting position.
13. Finally, save the route taken and grid points covered into the system memory for future reference.
