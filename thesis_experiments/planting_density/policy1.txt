1. Activate the RGB cameras and the lidar-inertial odometry system to observe and localize the environment.
2. Identify the 'concrete' landmarks using the RGB camera.
3. Use the GPS and lidar-inertial odometry system to navigate towards the 'concrete' landmarks.
4. Once arrived at the 'concrete' landmark, initialize an empty list to store all the planted locations.
5. Start the planting process with the 'grid' pattern. This means planting seeds at regular intervals of 1m x 1m as specified by the 'pattern_offset' key.
6. Plant the first seed at the current location and add this location to the list of planted locations.
7. Use the lidar-inertial odometry system to move 1m away horizontally from the first planted seed.
8. Plant the next seed and add this new location to the list of planted locations.
9. Repeat steps 7 and 8 until the end of the 'concrete' area is reached.
10. Upon reaching the end of the area, use the lidar-inertial odometry system to move 1m vertically from the first row of planted seeds.
11. Repeat steps 7 to 10 until the entire 'concrete' area is covered.
12. If any uncertainty or unexpected situation arises during the process, interface with the human operator for further directions.
13. After planting seeds throughout the 'concrete' area, save the list of planted locations to the system memory for future reference.
