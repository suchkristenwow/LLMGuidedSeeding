1. Start by enabling the robot's GPS and lidar-inertial odometry for precise localization.
2. Command the robot to use its RGB cameras to identify and locate the concrete area specified in the 'goal_lms' field of the constraint dictionary.
3. Once the concrete area is identified, create a virtual grid overlay on the area with a density of 1m x 1m as specified in the 'pattern_offset' field.
4. Command the robot to start at one corner of the concrete area.
5. Command the robot to plant a seed at the current position.
6. Save the coordinates of the planted location in the system memory.
7. Command the robot to move to the next grid point by navigating 1m over on the grid.
8. Repeat steps 5-7 for all points on the grid until the entire concrete area has been covered, making sure to avoid any objects specified in the "avoid" field.
9. Once all points on the grid have been seeded, perform a final sweep with the RGB cameras to confirm that seeds have been planted at all points on the grid.
10. If any grid point was missed or a seed was not successfully planted, command the robot to return to that point and plant a seed.
11. Once seeding is complete, provide a final report to the user summarizing the locations where seeds were planted and any obstacles that were avoided during the task.
