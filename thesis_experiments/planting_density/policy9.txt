1. Start by activating the lidar-inertial odometry and GPS system of the robot to determine its current location and orientation.
2. Activate the RGB cameras to identify the concrete area.
3. Use the localization data and the observed concrete area to plot a grid path across the area. The grid should have a density of 1m x 1m as per the 'pattern_offset' value.
4. Store the planned path into system memory.
5. Begin navigation towards the first point in the grid, while continuously using the RGB cameras and the lidar-inertial odometry system to monitor the surroundings for objects listed under "avoid".
6. Once at the first point, if the 'seed' value is true, plant a seed. 
7. Record the coordinates of the planted seed into system memory.
8. Move to the next point on the grid, monitoring the surroundings for objects to avoid, and repeat the planting and recording process.
9. Continue this process until all points on the grid within the concrete area have been seeded.
10. After seeding the entire grid, perform a final scan of the area to confirm all points have been addressed and no 'avoid' objects have entered the area.
11. Once the task is done, update the system status to complete, and send a task completion signal to the operator.
12. If there is any uncertainty at any step, interface with the human operator for further guidance.
