1. Initialize the system memory list for "planted locations".

2. Activate the robot's RGB cameras and lidar-inertial odometry for localization and landmark detection.

3. Begin the task by searching for the 'concrete area' landmark which is our goal location using the robot's RGB camera.

4. Once the 'concrete area' landmark is identified, the robot should navigate towards it using GPS guidance and lidar-inertial odometry for precision.

5. Upon reaching the 'concrete area', the robot should utilize its lidar-inertial odometry to establish the boundaries of the area.

6. According to the 'grid' pattern and 'pattern_offset' of 1m specified in the constraints, the robot should determine the locations within the 'concrete area' where it will plant the seeds. This can be done by creating a virtual grid on the 'concrete area' with each grid cell being 1m x 1m.

7. The robot should then start from the first grid location, plant a seed, and add this location to the 'planted locations' list in the system memory. 

8. The robot should then navigate to the next grid location maintaining the 1m offset distance, plant a seed, and add this location to the 'planted locations' list in the system memory.

9. Repeat steps 7 and 8 for all grid locations within the 'concrete area'.

10. Once all the grid locations within the 'concrete area' have been seeded, the robot should stop and update the task status as 'completed'.

11. The list of 'planted locations' should be saved and made accessible for future tasks or reference. 

Remember, the robot should always monitor for any objects to avoid and adjust its path accordingly. If an object is detected in a planned grid location, the robot should skip that location and move on to the next one.
