Given the task at hand, we must guide the autonomous robotic agent to navigate the area efficiently and plant seeds near field flags while avoiding any potential obstacles.

The Python script developed below adheres to the guidelines provided and manipulates the API functions effectively for the completion of the mission. It focuses on identifying field flags using the robot's sensors, navigating to these flags maintaining a strategic distance, and subsequently planting seeds. The constraints of the task, such as ensuring safety by checking if the robot is available, are thoroughly incorporated.

The image provided does not show obvious field flags, but the script treats the scenario as if field flags could appear within the robotâ€™s operational area and hence will carry out its scanning operation continuously.

>>> Start of the Python Code Execution

```python
import time

def wait_for_robot():
    while not is_available():
        time.sleep(0.1)  # Poll every 100 ms

def find_field_flags():
    flags = []
    objects = get_all_objects()
    for obj in objects.values():
        if obj['name'] == 'field flag' and not obj['visited']:
            p = Point(obj['position']['x'], obj['position']['y'], obj['position']['z'])
            flags.append(p)
    return flags

def navigate_and_plant_near_flag(flag_location):
    wait_for_robot()  # Ensure the robot is ready for new commands

    # Assuming landmark_offset specifies the distance to maintain from the flag for planting
    offset = 0.05  # 5 cm as specified

    # Assume robot's current position
    current_pose = get_position()

    # Direct movement to the location with a specified offset
    target_x = flag_location.x + offset
    target_y = flag_location.y + offset
    target_waypoint = Point(target_x, target_y, flag_location.z)

    # Navigate to the target waypoint
    if check_waypoint_in_bounds(target_waypoint):
        go_to_waypoint(target_waypoint)

    wait_for_robot()  # Wait for the robot to reach the location

    # Plant the seed
    plant()

    # Record the planting location
    print(f"Planted a seed near field flag at ({target_x}, {target_y})")
    
def execute_revegetation_task():
    # Step 1: Activate systems
    # Assuming system activations are handled internally on boot or by other means

    # Main operation loop
    while True:
        wait_for_robot()  # Always ensure the robot is available before operations

        # Step 2: Scan for field flags
        field_flags = find_field_flags()

        if not field_flags:
            print("No more field flags detected. Task completed.")
            break

        for flag in field_flags:
            # Step 6: Navigate to each flag and plant
            navigate_and_plant_near_flag(flag)

        # After all visible flags are handled, wait for new flags in case of missed detections
        time.sleep(5)  # Wait for 5 seconds before next scan

execute_revegetation_task()
```
<<< End of Python Code Execution

This script ensures that planting is executed near each detected field flag while adhering to operational constraints and managing robotic autonomy carefully. The vague or intermittent detection of flags will lead to re-scanning, ensuring a robust operational strategy in a dynamic environmental context.
