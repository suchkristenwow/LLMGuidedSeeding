1. Begin by initializing the robotic agent's navigational and seeding systems.
2. Access the list of 'field flags' from the system memory.
3. For each 'field flag', follow the steps below:
   1. Use the robot's RGB cameras, lidar-inertial odometry, and GPS to accurately locate the current 'field flag'.
   2. Once the 'field flag' is located, calculate the optimal path to the 'field flag' while maintaining a safe distance of 5 cm (as given by 'landmark_offset' in the constraint dictionary).
   3. Navigate the robot along the calculated path towards the 'field flag'.
   4. Upon reaching the 'field flag', confirm the location using the robot's localization capabilities.
   5. If the location is confirmed, activate the seeding mechanism of the robot to plant a seed within the 5 cm radius of the 'field flag'.
   6. Once the seed is planted, record the exact location of the planted seed in the system memory.
4. After all 'field flags' have been visited and the corresponding seeds have been planted, return the robot to its starting position.
5. Finally, save and update the list of planted locations in the system memory for future reference.
