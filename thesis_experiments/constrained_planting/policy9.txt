1. Initialize the robot's seed dispenser and set the landmark offset to 0.05 meters as per the constraint dictionary.
2. Activate the robot's RGB camera and lidar-inertial odometry system for observation and localization.
3. Initiate the robot's GPS system for additional navigation and localization support.
4. Command the robot to begin searching for 'field flags', the goal landmarks as per the constraint dictionary.
5. Once a 'field flag' is detected, use the robot's lidar-inertial odometry system to calculate the distance to the flag.
6. If the distance is more than 0.05 meters, command the robot to move closer to the 'field flag' until the distance is approximately 0.05 meters, maintaining a safe distance to avoid potential collision.
7. Once the robot is within the desired distance of the 'field flag', activate the seed dispenser to plant a seed.
8. Record the GPS location of the planted seed in the system memory.
9. Once the seeding process is complete, command the robot to move away from the 'field flag' and resume the search for the next 'field flag'.
10. Repeat steps 5-9 until all 'field flags' in the plot have been located and seeds have been planted near them.
11. Once all the 'field flags' have been located and seeds have been planted, command the robot to return to its starting position.
12. Finally, provide a report to the ecologists with a list of all the GPS coordinates where the seeds were planted.
