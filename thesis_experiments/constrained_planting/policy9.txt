1. Initialize the list of planted locations in the system memory.
2. Activate RGB cameras and Lidar-inertial odometry systems for detection and localization purposes.
3. Start scanning the rangeland area using the camera and lidar to identify 'field flags'.
4. Once a 'field flag' is detected, use the robot's GPS and odometry systems to navigate towards the flag.
5. Maintain a distance of 0.05 meters or 5 cm (as provided by the 'landmark_offset' in the constraint dictionary) from the 'field flag'.
6. Verify the position and distance from the flag using the localization systems.
7. If the 'seed' boolean is set to 'True', initiate the seed planting mechanism.
8. Plant the seed at the verified location.
9. Add the current GPS location to the list of planted locations in the system memory.
10. Move to the next 'field flag' and repeat steps 4-9 until all 'field flags' in the plot have been visited.
11. After all 'field flags' have been visited and seeds planted near them, stop the planting operation.
12. Save and store the list of planted locations for future reference and monitoring. 
13. Inform the user of the completion of the task with a detailed report of the planting locations.
