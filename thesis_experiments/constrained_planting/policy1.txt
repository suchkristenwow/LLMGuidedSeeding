1. Activate the RGB cameras and lidar-inertial odometry system to observe the surroundings and to localize the robot.
2. Activate the GPS system for an additional method of localization.
3. Begin navigating the plot, using the cameras to detect landmarks, specifically looking for field flags as indicated in the 'goal_lms' entry of the constraint dictionary.
4. Once a field flag is detected, navigate towards it.
5. Upon reaching the field flag, verify the robot is within the 5 cm offset as indicated by the 'landmark_offset' in the constraint dictionary.
6. If the robot is not within the 5 cm range, make necessary adjustments until the robot is within the required range.
7. Once within the required range, activate the seed planting mechanism, ensuring the 'seed' entry in the constraint dictionary is set to 'True'.
8. Plant the seeds at the current location.
9. Save the planted location to the system memory for future reference.
10. Repeat the process from step 3 for every field flag in the plot until all flags have been attended to.
11. If an "avoid" object is detected, alter the navigation path to bypass the object, removing its vertex from the planner graph.
12. Once all flags have been attended to, stop the seeding process and return the robot to its starting position.
