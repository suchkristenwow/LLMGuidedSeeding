1. Activate the robot's RGB cameras and GPS system for identifying the landmarks and for localization respectively.
2. Initiate the lidar-inertial odometry system to assist with precise positioning relative to the identified landmarks.
3. Use the RGB cameras to look for the 'field flag' landmarks as mentioned in the 'goal_lms' key of the constraint dictionary.
4. Once a 'field flag' landmark is detected, use the GPS and lidar-inertial odometry system to navigate towards the landmark.
5. As the robot approaches the field flag, ensure the offset of 0.05 meters (5 cm) as mentioned in 'landmark_offset' key. This can be achieved using lidar-inertial odometry data.
6. When the robot is positioned correctly, initiate the seed planting mechanism to plant a seed at the current location.
7. Store the GPS coordinates of the planted seed location in the system memory for future reference.
8. Repeat steps 3 to 7 for every 'field flag' landmark detected by the RGB cameras in the plot. 
9. Once all 'field flag' landmarks have been attended to and seeds have been planted, return the robot to the starting position.
10. Update the task status to complete and provide a report of all the planted locations for user review.
