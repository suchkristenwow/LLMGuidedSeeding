1. Activate RGB cameras and lidar-inertial odometry system for observation and localization.
2. Use the GPS to get a rough estimate of the robot's location.
3. Activate the planting mechanism to be prepared for seeding.
4. Begin scanning the surroundings using the RGB cameras for landmarks, specifically looking for 'field flags' as per the 'goal_lms' constraint.
5. Once a field flag is detected, navigate towards it, using lidar-inertial odometry and GPS for accurate positioning.
6. When within 5 cm of the field flag (according to the 'landmark_offset' constraint), execute the planting mechanism to plant a seed.
7. Record the GPS coordinates of the planted location in the system memory.
8. Move away from the flag and begin scanning for the next field flag.
9. Repeat steps 5-8 for each field flag detected.
10. Once all field flags have been detected and seeds planted accordingly, halt the planting mechanism.
11. Return to the starting position or navigate to the designated endpoint.
12. Update the system memory to indicate the completion of the task.
