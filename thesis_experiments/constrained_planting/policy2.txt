1. Activate the robot's GPS and lidar-inertial odometry systems for accurate location tracking and landmark detection.
2. Initiate the RGB cameras and begin the task.
3. Look for the 'field flag' landmarks within the plot bounds. 
4. Upon identifying a field flag, the robot should navigate towards it, maintaining a safe and continuous path to avoid any potential hazards.
5. Stop the robot when it reaches a position 5 cm away from the detected field flag. This is the 'landmark_offset' value from the constraint dictionary.
6. Check if the 'seed' value in the constraint dictionary is true, in which case the robot should plant a seed at the current location.
7. If the seed is planted successfully, record the current GPS coordinates in the system memory.
8. Continue to scan the area for more 'field flag' landmarks.
9. Repeat steps 4-7 for each identified field flag until all have been visited and a seed has been planted 5 cm away from each.
10. Once all field flags have been visited and a seed planted nearby each, the robot should stop and send a completion signal.
11. Finally, generate a report including the list of all planted locations from the system memory for future reference and analysis.
