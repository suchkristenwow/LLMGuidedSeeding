1. Activate RGB cameras and lidar-inertial odometry systems to observe the environment and locate the robot's position.

2. Engage the GPS system to receive accurate positioning data.

3. Use the vision system to search for the goal landmarks, in this case, the field flags.

4. Once a field flag is detected, calculate the distance to the flag using both GPS and lidar data.

5. Command the robot to navigate towards the detected flag, stopping when it is 5 cm (0.05 m, as per the 'landmark_offset' value) away.

6. If the 'seed' value is True (which it is in this case), command the robot to activate the seeding mechanism.

7. Plant a seed at the current location.

8. Record the coordinates of the planted location in the system memory.

9. Repeat steps 3-8 until all field flags have been located and a seed has been planted near each one.

10. Once all seeds have been planted as per the instructions, command the robot to return to its initial position.

11. Once the robot is back at its initial position, update the system memory to indicate that the task is complete.

12. Interface with the human user to report task completion and provide a list of all the locations where seeds have been planted.
