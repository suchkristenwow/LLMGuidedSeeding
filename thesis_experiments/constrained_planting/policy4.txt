1. Turn on the RGB camera and Lidar-inertial odometry systems for landmark detection and localization. Enable GPS for additional localization support.
2. Begin a search for the 'field flag' landmarks as defined in 'goal_lms' within the constraint dictionary.
3. Once a 'field flag' landmark is detected by the RGB camera, use the lidar-inertial odometry to compute the robot's distance to the flag.
4. If the robot is not within the required 5 cm range as specified by the 'landmark_offset' in the constraint dictionary, navigate towards the flag.
5. Repeat step 4 until the robot is within the desired 5 cm range of the field flag. Be sure to monitor the surroundings for any objects listed under "avoid". If such an object is detected, adjust the path to maintain a safe distance.
6. Once within the specified range, activate the planting mechanism and plant the seed.
7. Update the list in the system memory with the location of the newly planted seed.
8. Once the planting process is complete, continue the search for the next 'field flag' landmark.
9. Repeat steps 3 to 8 for every 'field flag' detected within the plot boundaries.
10. If no additional 'field flag' landmarks are detected, or all detected flags have had seeds planted near them, end the task.
11. Store the list of all planted locations and report it for further ecological analysis and monitoring.
