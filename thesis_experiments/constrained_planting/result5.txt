# Step 1: Activate the RGB camera and lidar-inertial odometry to locate and identify all field flags within the plot.
# Since the API does not provide a function to explicitly activate these devices, we assume that they are automatically activated.

# Step 2: Begin to navigate towards the first detected field flag using GPS and lidar-inertial odometry for precise localization.
# Step 3: As you approach each field flag, use the lidar-inertial odometry to maintain a distance of 0.05 meters (5 cm).
# Step 4: Upon reaching the designated offset from the field flag, initiate the seed planting procedure.
# Step 5: Record the location of the planted seed in the system memory.
