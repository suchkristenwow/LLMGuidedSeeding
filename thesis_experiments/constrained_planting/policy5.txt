1. Activate the RGB cameras and lidar-inertial odometry system for initial environment mapping and object detection.
2. Identify the field flags in the plot using the RGB cameras. 
3. Map the locations of the detected field flags using GPS.
4. Define a circular region with a radius of 0.05 meters (5 cm) around each flag. This will be the targeted planting area.
5. Activate the seed planting mechanism.
6. For each of the field flags:
    a. Navigate to the defined region around the flag using the GPS and lidar-inertial odometry data.
    b. Upon reaching the target, confirm the robot's position is within the defined area of the flag using the lidar-inertial odometry.
    c. Once confirmed, initiate the seeding process.
    d. Save the GPS coordinates of the seeded location in the system memory.
7. After all flags have been serviced, check the system memory to ensure all targeted areas have a corresponding planted seed location.
8. If any targeted areas are missing a planted seed location, repeat steps 6 and 7 for these specific areas.
9. Once the planting process is complete for all flags, save the final list of planted locations in the system memory for future reference and auditing.
10. Switch off the seed planting mechanism and the robot's navigational systems.
11. Return the robot to its original location or charging station.
