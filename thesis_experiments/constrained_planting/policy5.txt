1. Activate the RGB camera and lidar-inertial odometry to locate and identify all field flags within the plot.
2. Begin to navigate towards the first detected field flag using GPS and lidar-inertial odometry for precise localization.
3. As you approach each field flag, use the lidar-inertial odometry to maintain a distance of 0.05 meters (5 cm).
4. Upon reaching the designated offset from the field flag, initiate the seed planting procedure.
5. Record the location of the planted seed in the system memory.
6. Repeat steps 2 through 5 for each identified field flag within the plot.
7. After all field flags have been approached and seeds have been planted accordingly, return to the starting position.
8. Provide a summary report of all the planted locations to the user and save this report in the system memory for future reference.
9. Standby for any further instructions or tasks from the user.
