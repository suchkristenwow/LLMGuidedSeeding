1. Initialize the robotic agent and ensure it is ready to execute tasks.
2. Activate the RGB cameras and lidar-inertial odometry systems for navigation and localization.
3. Activate the GPS system for precise location tracking.
4. Start the landmark detection module with a focus on the 'field flag' as a target object to navigate towards.
5. Navigate towards the nearest detected 'field flag'. The robot should maintain a safe distance from all other objects.
6. Upon reaching a 'field flag', ensure the robot is positioned within the defined 5 cm landmark offset. 
7. If the position is accurate, plant a seed using the robot's seed planting mechanism.
8. Record the GPS location of the planted seed and add it to the system memory list of all planted locations.
9. Once the planting task is completed, move to the next nearest 'field flag'.
10. Repeat steps 5 to 9 until all 'field flags' have been visited and a seed has been planted within the defined offset of each one.
11. Upon completion of the planting task at all 'field flags', return to the starting position.
12. Provide a report to the user with a list of all planted locations and any notable events or exceptions during the execution of the task.
13. Standby for further instructions or tasks.
