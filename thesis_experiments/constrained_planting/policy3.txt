1. Activate the RGB cameras to start scanning for the 'field flag' which is listed under the 'goal_lms' in the constraint dictionary.
2. Activate the GPS and lidar-inertial odometry systems for localization and navigation towards the identified 'field flags'.
3. Once a 'field flag' is detected, calculate the distance to the flag. 
4. If the robot is farther than 0.05m (5cm, as listed under 'landmark_offset' in the constraint dictionary) from the 'field flag', move towards the flag until the robot is exactly 0.05m away from it.
5. Once the robot is 0.05m away from the 'field flag', activate the seed planting system (since 'seed' is listed as True in the constraint dictionary).
6. Plant a seed at the current location.
7. Record the location of the planted seed in the system memory.
8. Scan the surrounding area for more 'field flags' using the RGB cameras.
9. If another 'field flag' is detected, return to step 3.
10. If no more 'field flags' are detected, end the task.
