1. Activate the robot's observation system and set it to locate 'field flag' landmarks.
2. Start the localization system using lidar-inertial odometry and GPS to keep track of the robot's position.
3. Begin moving towards the closest detected 'field flag' while avoiding any objects listed under the "avoid" category.
4. Once the robot is within a 5 cm distance of the 'field flag' (as specified by 'landmark_offset'), prepare the seeding mechanism.
5. Plant the seed and record the current GPS coordinates in the system memory under 'planted locations'.
6. Resume the search for the next 'field flag'.
7. Repeat steps 3 to 6 until all 'field flags' have been detected and a seed has been planted within 5 cm of each.
8. After all seeds are planted, save and store the list of 'planted locations' in the system memory for future reference and possible follow-ups.
9. Send a completion message to the user notifying them of the task's completion and provide the list of 'planted locations'.
