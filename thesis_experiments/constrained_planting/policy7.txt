1. Activate the RGB camera and lidar-inertial odometry system on the robot to prepare for navigation and landmark detection.
2. Use the GPS to locate the plot boundaries and ensure the robot stays within them during the operation.
3. Search for the "field flag" landmarks in the plot using the robot's RGB cameras and lidar-inertial odometry system.
4. Once a field flag is detected, calculate the distance to the flag. If the robot is more than 5 cm away, adjust the robot's course to move closer.
5. When the robot is within the specified 5 cm range of a field flag, stop the robot.
6. Activate the seed planting mechanism to plant a seed in the current location.
7. Record the GPS coordinates of the planted seed in the system memory to maintain a list of all planted locations.
8. Repeat steps 3 to 7 for each detected field flag in the plot.
9. When all field flags have been detected and a seed has been planted near each one, return the robot to its starting position.
10. Upon completion, check the system memory to confirm that a seed has been planted near each field flag.
11. If there are any field flags that do not have a corresponding seed planting recorded, repeat steps 3 to 7 for these missed flags.
12. Once all flags have a corresponding planting, end the planting program and switch the robot to standby mode.
13. Provide a report to the human operator indicating the completion of the task, along with the list of GPS coordinates where seeds were planted.
