1. Use the onboard RGB cameras to search for the "field flag" landmark, the goal object as listed in the constraint dictionary.
2. Once a field flag is detected, use lidar-inertial odometry and GPS for localization and to accurately determine the distance to the field flag.
3. Navigate towards the field flag, ensuring to maintain a safe distance as specified by the 'landmark_offset' value in the constraint dictionary, which is 0.05 meters or 5 cm.
4. Upon reaching the desired location, which is within 5 cm of the field flag, initiate the seeding operation if 'seed' is set to True in the constraint dictionary.
5. Record the exact coordinates of the planted location in the system memory for future reference, as per the policy requirement when 'seed' is True.
6. After the seeding operation is complete, use the RGB cameras to search for the next field flag in the plot.
7. Repeat steps 2 to 5 for every field flag found in the plot.
8. Continue this process until all field flags in the plot have been found and seeds have been planted within 5 cm of each of them.
9. Once all field flags have been accounted for and the planting is completed, halt the operation and update the system status as 'task completed'.
