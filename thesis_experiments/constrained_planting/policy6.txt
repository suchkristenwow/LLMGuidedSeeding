1. Initialize the list for storing the locations where seeds have been planted.

2. Turn on the RGB cameras to observe landmarks and to detect field flags.

3. Using the GPS and lidar-inertial odometry, localize the robot in the plot.

4. Start moving within the plot, continually observing for the 'field flag' landmark using the RGB cameras.

5. Upon detecting a field flag, calculate the distance between the robot and the flag using the lidar-inertial odometry system.

6. If the distance is more than 5 cm, navigate the robot towards the flag while continually calculating the distance.

7. Once within the 5 cm range, stop the robot. 

8. Activate the seeding system to plant a seed at this location.

9. Record the location of the planted seed in the list initialized in step 1.

10. After the seed is planted, move away from the current field flag and resume search for the next field flag.

11. Continue repeating steps 4 to 10 until all field flags have been found and a seed has been planted near each one.

12. Once the task is complete, store the list of all planted locations in the system memory.
