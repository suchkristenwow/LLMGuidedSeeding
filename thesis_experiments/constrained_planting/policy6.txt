1. Activate RGB cameras and lidar-inertial odometry system for navigation and localization.
2. Start GPS tracking.
3. Activate object recognition for 'field flag'.
4. Navigate to the first 'field flag' detected while maintaining a safe distance of 5 cm.
5. Once the robot reaches the first flag, log the GPS coordinates and mark this position on the system map.
6. Repeat steps 4-5 for every 'field flag' in the plot.
7. If an 'avoid' object is detected in the robot's path, reroute the robot to ensure it does not come into contact with the object.
8. Once all flags have been located and logged, navigate to the first logged flag location.
9. Because the 'seed' value is False, no seeding is required. 
10. Move to the next logged flag location.
11. Repeat steps 9-10 until the robot has visited all logged flag locations.
12. Once all flag locations have been visited, return the robot to the starting position. 
13. End the task and provide a task completion report to the user.
