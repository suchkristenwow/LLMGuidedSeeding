1. Initialize the robot and confirm that it is in a ready state.
2. Activate the robot's RGB cameras to scan for landmarks and objects within its environment.
3. Begin navigating the lab, utilizing lidar-inertial odometry and GPS for localization. 
4. As the robot moves, have it continuously scan for the "goal_lms" which in this case is the "clear plastic container". 
5. During the navigation, if the robot identifies a "clear plastic container", instruct it to move towards the container while avoiding any obstacles along the path.
6. Once the robot has reached the container, activate its vision system to count the number of "field flags" within the container.
7. Store the count of the field flags in the system memory.
8. When counting is complete, stop further exploration as per the prompt instruction: "once you find the flags you can stop exploring".
9. Finally, relay the number of field flags counted back to the human operator for review.
