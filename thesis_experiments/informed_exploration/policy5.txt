1. Activate the RGB camera and lidar-inertial odometry system for navigation and object detection.
2. Begin exploring the laboratory environment, using GPS and odometry data to avoid revisiting areas already explored.
3. Continually scan the environment for any objects matching the description of "plastic container" and "field flags".
4. If an object resembling a "plastic container" is detected, move towards it while continuously scanning for any objects listed in the "avoid" list.
5. Once arrived at the "plastic container", scan the container for "field flags".
6. Count the number of "field flags" detected in the container using the robot's visual processing capabilities.
7. Save the count and the location of the container in the system memory.
8. After counting the flags, confirm that no more exploration is needed as per the prompt instructions and stop the exploration process.
9. Report the count and the location of the container with the "field flags" to the user.
