1. Initialize an empty list in the system memory to keep track of detected flags.
2. Activate the robot's RGB cameras and lidar-inertial odometry system for exploration and localization.
3. Begin to explore the lab, navigating towards any detected "clear plastic container", which is the goal landmark according to the constraints dictionary.
4. Use the robot's RGB cameras to detect any field flags within the clear plastic container once it is found.
5. For each detected flag, increment a counter variable in the system memory. This variable is used to keep track of the total number of field flags detected.
6. Add the location of each detected field flag to the previously initialized list in the system memory. This will help in keeping track of where each flag was found.
7. Continue the exploration and detection process until all the field flags within the clear plastic container are counted.
8. Once all flags are accounted for, the robot should stop exploring as per the prompt.
9. Finally, relay the total count of the field flags to the user and provide the list of locations where each flag was found.
