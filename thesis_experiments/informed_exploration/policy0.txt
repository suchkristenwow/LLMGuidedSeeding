1. Initialize the robot's systems and make sure all sensors (RGB cameras, lidar, GPS, and inertial odometry) are functioning correctly.
2. Start the exploration of the laboratory using the robot's autonomous navigation capabilities.
3. While navigating, the robot should continuously scan the environment using its RGB cameras to search for the 'field flags' and 'clear plastic container' as specified in the 'search' and 'goal_lms' keys respectively in the constraint dictionary.
4. The robot should also use its lidar and GPS systems to localize itself within the laboratory and avoid any obstacles.
5. When a 'clear plastic container' is detected by the RGB cameras, the robot should navigate towards it while maintaining safety and avoiding any obstacles detected by the lidar and GPS.
6. Once the robot reaches the 'clear plastic container', it should use its RGB cameras to observe and count the number of 'field flags' inside it.
7. The robot should keep a running count of the number of 'field flags' observed in the system memory.
8. As specified in the prompt, the robot should stop exploring once it finds the 'field flags'.
9. The robot should then transmit the final count of the 'field flags' to the human user for further instructions or completion of the task.
