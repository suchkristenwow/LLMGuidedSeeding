1. Initialize the system, ensuring all sensors and actuators are working properly.
2. Activate the RGB cameras to observe the environment.
3. Use lidar-inertial odometry and GPS for localization and navigation within the laboratory environment.
4. Start a search pattern to explore the laboratory environment. It can be a spiral, zig-zag, or grid-based pattern depending on the layout of the lab.
5. Use the RGB camera to continuously scan the environment for the "clear plastic container" which is listed as the goal landmark in the constraint dictionary.
6. If the "clear plastic container" is found, navigate towards it while avoiding any obstacles. Use lidar-inertial odometry and GPS for accurate navigation.
7. Once reached the "clear plastic container", use the RGB camera to observe and count the "field flags" which are mentioned in the 'search' key of the constraint dictionary.
8. Store the count of the "field flags" in the system memory.
9. Once all flags in the container are counted, stop the exploration as per the instructions in the prompt.
10. Record the location of the "clear plastic container" for future reference.
11. Send a report to the user detailing the number of flags found and the location of the container.
