1. Initialize the system's GPS and Lidar-inertial odometry for accurate positioning and localization.
2. Begin exploring the laboratory environment, using the robot's RGB cameras to visually identify landmarks.
3. While exploring, scan for the 'clear plastic container' mentioned in the 'goal_lms' parameter.
4. If the 'clear plastic container' is not immediately found, continue exploration in a systematic pattern to cover the entire laboratory.
5. Upon identification of the 'clear plastic container', approach the container while maintaining safe navigation protocols.
6. Upon reaching the container, use the robot's vision system to count the number of 'field flags' inside the container.
7. Store the count of 'field flags' in the system memory.
8. Once the 'field flags' have been counted, stop further exploration as per the prompt instructions.
9. Finally, communicate the count of 'field flags' back to the ecologist for their record and further instruction.
