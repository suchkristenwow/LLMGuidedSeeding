1. Initialize the robot's vision and navigation systems to be ready for the exploration task. 

2. Using its RGB cameras, the robot should start scanning the laboratory environment for the specified 'goal_lms' which is a 'clear plastic container'. 

3. While exploring, the robot should also keep track of its location and path using lidar-inertial odometry and GPS.

4. If the 'clear plastic container' is found, the robot should approach the container carefully while avoiding any obstacles detected by its sensors.

5. Once it is near the container, the robot should start counting the number of 'field flags' present in the container.

6. The robot should use its RGB cameras to visually identify and count each individual 'field flag'. 

7. Once the counting task is finished, the robot should store the count in its system memory.

8. Finally, the robot should stop exploring as per the user's instruction that once the flags are found, the exploration can be stopped.

9. The robot should communicate the final count of the 'field flags' to the user. This could be done through a display or any other communication means available. 

10. With the task completed, the robot can then either return to its starting point or await further instructions.
