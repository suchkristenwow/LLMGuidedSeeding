1. Activate the robot's RGB cameras and lidar-inertial odometry system to start the observation and localization process.
2. Start exploring the laboratory environment in a systematic pattern such as a grid or spiral, which ensures full coverage of the area.
3. As the robot moves, it should continuously monitor its surroundings for the presence of a clear plastic container.
4. If the robot's cameras detect an object that might be a clear plastic container, pause the exploration.
5. Approach the detected object carefully while maintaining a safe distance. 
6. Verify if the detected object is indeed the clear plastic container with field flags using visual recognition algorithms.
7. If the object is confirmed to be the container with field flags, proceed to the next step. If not, go back to step 2 and continue the exploration.
8. Count the number of field flags in the container. The robot can use image processing techniques to identify and count individual flags.
9. Record the total count of field flags and their location in the system memory.
10. Stop the exploration once the flags have been counted since the prompt specifies that all flags are in one container. If more containers are detected, they can be ignored.
11. Provide feedback to the ecologist or user with the number of field flags found and their location.
