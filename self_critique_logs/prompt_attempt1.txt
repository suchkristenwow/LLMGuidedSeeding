You are guiding an autonomous robotic agent to execute the prompt given below. The robot is supposed to help ecologists with tasks related to revegetation of degraded rangelands.
In order to practice policy execution, you will first help control this simulated robot to make sure the policies are safe and effective. 

This is the prompt: Driving in a lawn-mower pattern, plant in 6 locations evenly spaced over the plot. Avoid driving over the blue tape on the floor. 

The user has provided a description of the following objects which are important to completing this task: 
Tape comes in rectangular strips. Blue tape is blue. The tape is on the floor. There could be large patches of it, or long skinny strips. The width is about 1 in and the 
length is variable. The tape has a matte appearance. 


The robot is able to observe landmarks via RGB cameras and it is able to plant seeds. The robot is capable of localization using lidar-inertial odometry as well as GPS. 

The robot is given the operational bounds in the robot coordinate frame. This variable is called "plot_bounds". The plot bounds are given as a nx2 np array describing the
contour. It is important that the robot operate inside the bounds and never plan to drive outside of the plot bounds. If the robot begins outside of the plot bounds, the 
first step will be to plan the shortest route possible to be inside the bounds.

To execute the desired task, the ecologist has written you this list of steps:
1. Initialize the task by checking the robot's current location within the plot bounds. If it is not inside the plot bounds, plan the shortest route to enter the plot bounds.
2. Find 6 evenly spaced points within the plot bounds. 
3. Navigate the robot such that you can plant at those points, avoiding driving over the blue tape. 

The scale is in meters. That is, if an object is supposed to be 10 cm long, you should do: thing_length = 0.1 

Please write some Python code that would execute this policy. 

In order to do so, please use the following classes and functions. 

Consider the following guidelines:
- Use base Python (comparison, sorting) for basic logical operations, left/right/up/down, math, etc.
- You are encouraged to use the given functions below and the simBot class implementation but not all of it will always be applicable so you are encouraged to write your own 
  functions if need be. 
- Use the given generate_with_openai function to access external information if necessary.
- You are operating autonomously so you cannot call any functions or classes that haven't already been named and expect the user to implement them on their own. 
- Whatever you come up with will be executed like this: 
    # Execute the code directly
        exec(code, {'config_path': self.config_path, 'plot_bounds': self.plot_bounds, 'init_pose': initted_pose, 'targets': self.targets, 'obstacles': self.obstacles}, local_scope) 
    That is, config_path, plot_bounds, init_pose, targets, obstacles are all in your local scope. These are everything you need to init the simBot and robotTransforms classes. 

- Note that the first and last coordinate of plot_bounds is the same (as this is a requirement for making Polygon objects using the shapely library). The plot_bounds describe 
 an arbitrary shape drawn by the user. If you want to iterate over the bounds (to navigate using a pattern, for example) you should use the shapely library to operate over the contour.

Can you re-write this code so that it runs? 

Remember that shapely Polygon objects can't be unpacked. If you want to access the points on the perimeter you can do so using foo.exeterior.coords, and you can subsequently access 
the x and y coordinates of each point on the perimeter like so: point.x or point.y. That is each coord from foo.exeterior.coords is a shapely Point object. 

You are operating autonomously so you cannot call any functions or classes that haven't already been named and expect the user to implement them on their own. 

Remember that in order to drive the robot in the sim, you can do so by calling simBot.go_to_waypoint() or simBot.follow_path() - see those implementations for more information. 
That is, if the user asks the robot to drive in a pattern, you need to initialize waypoints in that pattern within the plot bounds and then call simBot.go_to_waypoint()
