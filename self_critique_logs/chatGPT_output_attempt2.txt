Apologies for the confusion, and thank you for your patience. From the error, it seems like there is a line of code where a string is being treated like a list or an array. The line causing the issue is likely where there is a label or key being accessed. Let's try to pinpoint this issue. 

Please replace the initialization of `simBot` and the usage of its methods with placeholders for now to isolate the problem. The string indices issue is likely arising from accessing data from the dictionary or list incorrectly. Here's an example:

```python
# Replace with your actual plot bounds
plot_bounds = np.array([[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 0], [0, 0]])

# Create a placeholder class for simBot
class PlaceholderSimBot:
    def __init__(self, plot_bounds):
        self.plot_bounds = plot_bounds
        self.current_waypoint = np.zeros(6)
    
    def in_plot_bounds(self):
        return True

    def get_current_pose(self):
        return np.zeros(6)
    
    def go_to_waypoint(self):
        pass
    
    def plant(self):
        pass

# Replace with your actual parameters
robot = PlaceholderSimBot(plot_bounds)

# Continue with your previous code but replace actual simBot methods with placeholders
pose = robot.get_current_pose()
if not robot.in_plot_bounds():
    nearest_point_on_perimeter = nearest_points(Polygon(np.array(plot_bounds)), Point(pose[0], pose[1]))[1]
    robot.current_waypoint = np.array([nearest_point_on_perimeter.x, nearest_point_on_perimeter.y, 0, 0, 0, 0])
    robot.go_to_waypoint()

def get_six_even_points(bounds):
    hull = ConvexHull(bounds)
    points = hull.points
    points = sorted(points, key=lambda k: [k[0], k[1]])
    return points[::len(points)//6]

six_points = get_six_even_points(plot_bounds)

for point in six_points:
    waypoint = np.array([point[0], point[1], 0, 0, 0, 0])
    robot.current_waypoint = waypoint
    robot.go_to_waypoint()
    robot.plant()
```

This script should run without the "string indices must be integers" error because we've replaced the simBot operations with placeholders. If you still get the error, then there might be an issue with the data you're passing to these functions, possibly `plot_bounds`. If the script runs without error, then the issue lies within your `simBot` class methods. In that case, you should check those methods to see where you might be using string indices. 

For instance, you might be using a label as a key in a dictionary to access some data and that's where the issue is coming from. Or, there might be a discrepancy between how your data is structured and how you're trying to access it. Please carefully review your `simBot` class and the data you're passing to its methods. 

The issue is not with your policy but with how your simBot class is handling or accessing the data.
