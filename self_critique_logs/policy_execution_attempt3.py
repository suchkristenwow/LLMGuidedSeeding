return points[::len(points)//6]
```

Here, `len(points)//6` might be returning 0 when the number of points is less than 6, resulting in a slice step of 0.

To resolve this, we can add a check to ensure we don't attempt to slice with a step of 0. If the number of points is less than 6, we'll return the points as they are. If there are 6 or more, we'll return the six points as before. Here's the updated `get_six_even_points` function:

```python
def get_six_even_points(bounds):
    hull = ConvexHull(bounds)
    points = hull.points
    points = sorted(points, key=lambda k: [k[0], k[1]])
    if len(points) < 6:
        return points
    else:
        return points[::len(points)//6]
