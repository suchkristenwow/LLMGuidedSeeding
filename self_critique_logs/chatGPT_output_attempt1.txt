Your code seems to be correct in terms of structure and logic. However, the error message "string indices must be integers" is typically raised when a string is being indexed with something other than an integer. It seems like a string is being indexed in your original code, perhaps where a list or array should be. 

Here is a corrected version of your code:

```python
import numpy as np
from shapely.geometry import Polygon, Point
from shapely.ops import nearest_points
from scipy.spatial import ConvexHull

# Initialize simBot
robot = simBot(config_path, plot_bounds, init_pose, targets, obstacles)

# Step 1: Initialize the task by checking the robot's current location within the plot bounds.
pose = robot.get_current_pose()
if not robot.in_plot_bounds():
    nearest_point_on_perimeter = nearest_points(Polygon(np.array(plot_bounds)), Point(pose[0], pose[1]))[1]
    robot.current_waypoint = np.array([nearest_point_on_perimeter.x, nearest_point_on_perimeter.y, 0, 0, 0, 0])
    robot.go_to_waypoint()

# Function to get six evenly spaced points in the given plot bounds
def get_six_even_points(bounds):
    hull = ConvexHull(bounds)
    points = hull.points
    points = sorted(points, key=lambda k: [k[0], k[1]])
    return points[::len(points)//6]

# Step 2: Find 6 evenly spaced points within the plot bounds.
six_points = get_six_even_points(plot_bounds)

# Step 3: Navigate the robot to the points and plant at those points, avoiding the blue tape.
for point in six_points:
    # Get waypoint to the point
    waypoint = plant_with_offset(robot.static_transformer, robot.get_current_pose(), point, 0)
    robot.current_waypoint = waypoint
    robot.go_to_waypoint()
    
    # Plant at the waypoint
    robot.plant()
```
I used the nearest_points function from shapely.ops instead of the non-existent Polygon.nearest_points. Also, I converted the plot_bounds list into a numpy array when creating a Polygon object because shapely geometry objects require numpy arrays or lists of tuples, not lists of lists.

Additionally, I removed the initialization of six_points at the top of the code because it's not used there, and the list gets properly defined and used later on in the code.

Finally, I used a lambda function in the sorted() call to properly sort the points by their x and y coordinates. The itemgetter() function you were using before wasn't working because it expects each item in the list to be a tuple or list with at least two items, but the points in your list are shapely Point objects.
