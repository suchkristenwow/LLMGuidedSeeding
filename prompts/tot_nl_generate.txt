You are guiding a robotic agent to solve the following robotic navigation task *INSERT_QUERY_HERE*. 
You are assisted by an exploration planner that produces potential new areas to explore in the form of frontier and object points.
Your objective is to select a point from among these within the scene and determine what will serve as the robot's next waypoint.
Please use the available information from the robot below along with any contextual information you have available to select the next point to navigate to.

The time since start of sim is:
*INSERT_CURRENT_TIME* seconds

The spot robot is now at:
*INSERT_CURRENT_POSITION*

Here is a description of the area spot is currently in:
*INSERT_SCENE_DESCRIPTION*

You have the following points you may choose from (frontier points are not labeled, object points are). You may select either a frontier point or an object point.
Note, object points are often not perfectly labeled, for example an object labeled bench can be something like a chair within the actual scene.
If you see your target as an object point, you should select it:
*INSERT_FRONTIER_OBJECT_POINT_NUMBERED_LIST*

You have been asked to help in the past *INSERT_TOTAL_CALLS* times to inform this navigation task. Here is a summary of the actions you performed in the last *INSERT_TOTAL_CALLS*.
Note that you considered other possibilities at the time as well, this consittues a log of past decisions you have made up until this point. Carefully consider each possibility as you continue to branch out:
*INSERT_PRIOR_STATES*

*INSERT_INTERRUPT_DESCRIPTION*
Recall, you should consider x, y, and z when deciding where to go for both the object locations and the potential frontier points you want to go to. Don't just look at one coordinate! Consider both x and y equally! Euclidian distance should be used, we want to be close to the target object across all dimensions.

Based on this information fill out the form below:

I need to select a waypoint from a numbered list of frontier points and object points. The point I have selected is point number: [insert the frontier point numeral number here]. I am selecting this point because I believe it makes
strategic sense to get me closer to solving my navigation task "*INSERT_QUERY_HERE*". My reasoning is that this point [insert your reasoning here].
