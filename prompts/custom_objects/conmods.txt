Conmods are little fences made of chicken wire that ecologists use to help aid in degraded rangeland restoration. Conmods are 2 pieces of wire mesh staked together. 
Viewed from the top, they look like a cross or a + sign, but they are rectangular in shape if viewed from the side. They are about 30 cm across and about 6 in tall. 

In certain lights, the sun may make it appear as though the mesh is glass or acrylic. 

With new conmods you can see the metal mesh well, but in older ones, they look like mounds of dirt. They also tend to collect tumbleweeds since the rangeland is 
usually pretty windy and bare. 

Conmods are usually found in neat rows and columns as humans place them in straight lines.
