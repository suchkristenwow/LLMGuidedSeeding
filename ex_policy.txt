Validate Plot Bounds: Ensure the plot_bounds are correctly loaded and define a valid rectangular area. Check for any data inconsistencies or boundary errors.

Map the Plot: Utilize the robot's RGB cameras and lidar to create a detailed map of the current state of the plot, identifying all landmarks including already planted areas 
and any conmods (construction modules or other obstacles). This step is crucial for planning the planting paths.

Plan Planting Grid: Based on the 1m x 1m grid pattern specified, compute the grid coordinates within the plot bounds. Each point in the grid represents a target location 
for planting a seed.

Path Planning: Develop a path that allows the robot to traverse to each grid point for planting. Use an algorithm that minimizes travel distance and avoids crossing over any 
previously planted seeds or conmods. Consider algorithms like A* for efficient pathfinding, incorporating the 'avoid' constraints into the traversal cost calculations.

Seed Planting Operation: For each grid point in the planned path:
    Navigate to the grid point using GPS and lidar-inertial odometry for precise localization.
    Before planting, perform a final check with RGB cameras to ensure the spot is free of obstacles or prior plantings not detected in the initial mapping.
    Plant a seed at the location. Confirm seed deposition with sensor feedback if available.

Monitor and Adjust: After planting at each grid point, update the plot map to mark the area as planted. This is essential to maintain an accurate record for the avoidance 
algorithm and for any future planting operations in this plot.

Repeat Planting: Continue to the next grid point following the planned path. Repeat the seeding process until all points in the grid have been addressed.

Final Survey: Once all planting is completed, perform a final survey of the plot to ensure all areas are planted as per the grid pattern and to check for any missed or 
improperly planted spots. Use the RGB cameras for visual confirmation.

Logging and Reporting: Log all planting activities, including any deviations from the planned path or planting issues. Provide a final report summarizing the planting operation, 
areas covered, and any anomalies encountered.
