The planted areas are just the areas immediately around where you already planted. So at the beginning, there is nothing to avoid. You should keep track of where you've planted 
and then avoid driving in a 15 cm radius of that location. You can do this by computing the transform for each of the wheels given the pose estimate of the robot. Then 
you can be sure to not run over places where you just seeded. 

You should also be able to tell visually where you've driven because you will see tire marks on the ground. 
The tire marks will look like 2 sets of darker channels in the dirt and they'll show up any time you drive through dirt or sand. Given you see tire marks, you can compute
the transform between the wheels and the seeder to determine where you could have seeded.
