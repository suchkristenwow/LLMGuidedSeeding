A ConMod is a tool used by rangeland ecologists to help improve the connectivity of vegetation in degraded rangelands. 

Conmods are x-shaped screens that are staked into the ground. They are found in open rangelands and fields where cattle might graze. They are only about 15-30cm  tall, 
and sometimes they are installed in straight rows. Conmods are made of metal chicken wire or hardware cloth (metal mesh screens). Conmods are about 30cm in diameter. 
They help grass grow and help with soil retention, as such there are typically patches of vegetation that grow around them, and they sometimes form small hills of soil 
around them. From the top they look like a plus sign made out of metal. From the side, sometimes they can look like small fences that are made of plastic or glass due 
to the lighting.
