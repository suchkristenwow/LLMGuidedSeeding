1. Verify that the robot is located within the plot bounds. If not, plan and execute the shortest route to enter the plot bounds.

2. Initialize an empty list in the system memory to store all the locations where seeds have been planted.

3. Identify the landmarks marked as "yellow and black striped tape" using the RGB cameras.

4. Choose 6 evenly spaced points within the plot bounds 

5. Find a lawnmower pattern which intersects these points. A lawnmower pattern is one that moves back and forth in parallel lines.

6. Following the lawnmower pattern, continually check for pieces of yellow and black striped tape. If the tape is detected, plan around it and navigate back to the main path. 

7. Once the robot has reached the position such that the planter is over one of the chosen points from Step 4, stop driving and plant a seed. 

8. Record the planting location in the list initialized in Step 2. 

9. Continue this process until all 6 seeds have been planted.
