1. Initialize the robot's systems, ensuring that the camera, lidar-inertial odometry, and GPS systems are operational and ready for use. 

2. Begin the exploration process within the lab environment, systematically scanning the environment and creating a map using lidar-inertial odometry and GPS for localization. 

3. Use the RGB camera to continuously look for the field flags mentioned in the prompt.

4. Each time an object of interest (in this case, the flags) is detected, note its location and count on the system memory.

5. If an object is detected that matches the description of a clear plastic container under a window, approach it cautiously for a closer inspection.

6. Once the container is located, examine the contents carefully to confirm that it contains the field flags. 

7. If the container contains the flags, stop the exploration process. The task of finding the flags is completed. 

8. Count the number of flags in the container and store this information in the system memory.

9. Update the constraint dictionary with the total number of flags counted and their location.

10. Report back to the user the number of flags found and their location within the lab. 

Remember, as there are no objects listed to be avoided in the constraint dictionary, the robot can freely move around the lab without removing any vertices from the planner graph.
