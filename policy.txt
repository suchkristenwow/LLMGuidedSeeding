1. Initialize a blank list in the system memory to store the planted locations.
2. Initialize the robot's location using the GPS system. 
3. Use the lidar-inertial odometry system to accurately track the robot's movements.
4. Use the RGB camera to observe and identify any 'conmods' or 'planted areas'.
5. If any 'conmods' or 'planted areas' are identified, record their location and exclude them from the planner graph.
6. Begin to move in a straight line towards the initial point of the grid.
7. Once the robot reaches the first point on the grid, pause and plant a seed.
8. Record this location in the system memory under the list of planted locations.
9. Move one meter to the right while avoiding any 'conmods' or 'planted areas'.
10. Repeat steps 7 to 9 for the entire row.
11. After completing a row, move one meter forward to start the next row, while avoiding any 'conmods' or 'planted areas'.
12. Repeat steps 7 to 11 until the entire area has been planted.
13. Once all seeds are planted, review the list of planted locations in system memory to ensure all points of the grid have been covered.
14. If any points are missing, navigate to these points while avoiding any 'conmods' or 'planted areas', and repeat steps 7 and 8.
15. Once all points have been planted, the task is completed and the robot can be returned to its initial location using the GPS system.
16. The robot's system memory should retain the list of planted locations for future reference and to avoid these areas in subsequent tasks.
