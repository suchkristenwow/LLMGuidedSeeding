1. First, check the current location using GPS and lidar-inertial odometry to ensure the robot is within the plot bounds. If the robot is outside the bounds, plan and execute the shortest route to be inside the plot bounds. 

2. Once inside the bounds, begin localization and scanning of the environment using RGB cameras to detect any pre-existing 'planted areas' or 'conmods' to be avoided. If any of these objects are detected, mark their location in the system memory.

3. Begin to establish a 1m x 1m grid pattern within the plot bounds for planting. Ensure this grid avoids any marked locations from step 2. 

4. Once the planting grid has been established, begin navigation towards the first grid point. If an object from the 'avoid' list is detected on route to the grid point, reroute to avoid the object.

5. Upon reaching the first grid point, execute the seeding process if the 'seed' boolean in the constraint dictionary is True.

6. Once seeding is complete, mark the location in the system memory as a 'planted area'. 

7. Then, navigate to the next point in the established grid pattern. Repeat steps 4 to 6 for all points in the grid pattern until the entire grid has been seeded.

8. If at any point during navigation, the robot encounters an unknown object that could be a 'conmod', ask the user for clarification: "I have found an unknown object. Could this be a conmod?"

9. Once all points in the grid have been seeded, confirm the completion of the task to the user: "All points in the grid have been successfully seeded. The task is complete."

10. Finally, ensure all locations of the 'planted areas' are stored in the system memory for future reference and tasks. 

Please note, this policy ensures the robot will avoid driving over already planted areas and any conmods, as per the prompt and constraint dictionary.
