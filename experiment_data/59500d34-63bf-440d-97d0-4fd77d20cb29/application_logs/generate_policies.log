parsing prompt to get constraints ...
llm_result: To format the constraints of the prompt into a dictionary with the specified keys, we can break it down as follows:

- "goal_lms": Not explicitly mentioned in the prompt, but could be specified based on the environment. For example, if there are specific landmarks to avoid or target for planting.
- "avoid": Specifies what areas to avoid driving over, in this case, wherever seeds have been planted or any "conmods".
- "pattern": Indicates the planting pattern, in this case, a 1m x 1m grid.
- "landmark_offset": Represents the distance to avoid when planting near landmarks.
- "search": Not explicitly mentioned in the prompt, but could be used to specify any additional search parameters if needed.
- "seed": Set to "True" as the robot should plant in the specified pattern.
- "pattern_offset": Represents the distance between seeds in the grid pattern.

Based on this breakdown, the dictionary format for the given prompt could be:

{"avoid": ["planted", "conmods"], "pattern": "grid", "seed": "True", "pattern_offset": 1.0}

If this format aligns with your requirements, we can proceed with this interpretation. Otherwise, please provide any necessary adjustments or additional details for further refinement.
results_str:  {"avoid": ["planted", "conmods"], "pattern": "grid", "seed": "True", "pattern_offset": 1.0}

Question:  I believe this policy should complete the desired task. What do you think?
1. Initialize robot within the plot bounds defined by the "plot_bounds" variable.
2. Set the pattern offset to 1.0 meters as specified in the constraint dictionary.
3. Begin scanning the environment using RGB cameras to locate any existing planted areas or conmods (constructions or man-made objects) to avoid driving over them.
4. Start the planting process by navigating the robot to the first grid position in the 1mx1m grid within the plot bounds.
5. Plant seeds in the designated grid position while ensuring that the robot does not drive over any planted areas or conmods.
6. Move the robot to the next grid position in the 1mx1m grid, following the defined grid pattern offset of 1.0 meters.
7. Repeat the planting process in each grid position while avoiding areas where seeds have already been planted or any conmods present.
8. Continue navigating and planting seeds in a systematic grid pattern until the entire bounded area has been covered.
9. Upon completion, verify that all seeds have been planted in the specified grid pattern within the plot bounds while avoiding previously planted areas and conmods.
10. Notify the user of the successful completion of planting in a 1mx1m grid while adhering to the constraints provided.
Feedback: enhanced verification response:  The following paragraph is feedback from the user on a policy. Based on the following response, does the user approve of this policy? Return "True" if so, and "False" otherwise.
If the user suggests any changes, return False. 

Add a step where you update a list of planted seed locations so you can avoid them
