1. Check current location using lidar-inertial odometry and GPS to ensure the robot is within the plot bounds.
2. Begin scanning the immediate environment using RGB cameras to identify any landmarks of interest, specifically "conmods" and areas where seeds have been previously planted.
3. If a "conmods" landmark is not immediately visible, ask the user for guidance: "I can't find any conmods, where should I look?"
4. Start planning a route to the nearest unseeded location within the plot bounds to begin planting seeds in a 1mx1m grid pattern.
5. Once a suitable location is identified, position the robot and plant a seed.
6. Check the surroundings for any obstacles or previously planted seeds to avoid driving over them.
7. Continue planting seeds in a grid pattern, maintaining a 1m distance between each seed.
8. Periodically reassess the location using lidar-inertial odometry and GPS to ensure the robot remains within the plot bounds.
9. If any issues arise or further guidance is needed, communicate with the user for assistance.
