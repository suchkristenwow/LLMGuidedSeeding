1. Check if the robot is within the operational bounds specified in the "plot_bounds". If not, calculate the shortest route to enter the plot without violating any "avoid" constraints.

2. Begin to map out a 1m x 1m grid pattern within the plot bounds, taking care to avoid any "planted area" or "conmods".

3. Starting from the nearest grid point, move to that location while avoiding any areas specified in the "avoid" entry.

4. Upon reaching the grid point, if the "seed" boolean is True, plant a seed. Add this location to the list of planted locations in the system memory.

5. Proceed to the next nearest unvisited grid point, again avoiding any areas specified in the "avoid" entry. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until all grid points within the plot bounds have been visited and seeded.

6. If the robot encounters a landmark in the "goal_lms" which it can't locate in the immediate environment, interface with the human user and ask: "I can't find {landmark}, where should I look?"

7. After all grid points have been visited and seeds planted where necessary, return to the starting position while avoiding all areas specified in the "avoid" entry.

8. Notify the user upon successful completion of the task.
