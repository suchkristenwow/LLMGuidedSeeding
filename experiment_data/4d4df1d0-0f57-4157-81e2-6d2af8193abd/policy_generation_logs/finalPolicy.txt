1. First, check the robot's current location against the plot_bounds variable in the system memory to ensure that the robot is inside the operational bounds. 

2. If the robot is outside the plot_bounds, calculate the shortest path into the bounds, avoid any listed obstacles from the 'avoid' entry in the constraint dictionary. Navigate to the plot bounds.

3. If the robot is already within the plot_bounds, proceed to the next step.

4. Check the 'avoid' list in the constraint dictionary. Keep these objects in the robot's system memory to actively avoid them during operation. 

5. Start at one corner of the plot and begin to navigate in a grid pattern with a spacing of 1m x 1m, as per the 'pattern' and 'pattern_offset' entries in the constraint dictionary. 

6. At each grid intersection, if the 'seed' entry in the constraint dictionary is True, perform a check to make sure there are no objects from the 'avoid' list in the immediate vicinity.

7. If there are no 'avoid' objects nearby, proceed to plant a seed at this grid intersection.

8. Log the location of each planted seed into the system memory to ensure these areas are avoided in future movements and tasks.

9. Repeat steps 6-8 until all grid intersections within the plot bounds have been covered.

10. If at any point the robot cannot locate a clear path due to an obstruction from the 'avoid' list, interface with the human operator and request additional directions.

11. After all grid intersections within the plot bounds have been seeded and logged, complete the task. 

12. Report to the user that the task has been completed successfully, and provide the list of planted locations for their reference.
