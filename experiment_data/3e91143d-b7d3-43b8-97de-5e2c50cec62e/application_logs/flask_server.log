Received message: I believe this policy should complete the desired task. What do you think?
1. Start by checking the current location of the robot. If it's outside the operational bounds, find the shortest route to get inside the bounds and move there.

2. Using the onboard RGB camera, identify the plot's landmarks, including any conmods (containers of modulars) and previously planted areas.

3. If conmods are not immediately identifiable in the environment, inform the user by saying "I can't find conmods, where should I look?" and follow the user's instruction.

4. Create a virtual grid map of 1mx1m squares over the operational bounds in the robot's memory. The 'pattern_offset' value of 1 indicates that seeds should be planted every 1 meter.

5. Starting from the closest grid point to the robot's current position, plan the route to that point while avoiding all conmods and previously planted areas.

6. Drive to the first grid point, ensuring to avoid all obstacles including conmods and previously planted areas.

7. Once at the grid point, plant a seed and add this location to the list of planted locations in the system memory.

8. Check the next closest unvisited grid point and plan the route to it while avoiding all conmods and previously planted areas.

9. Repeat steps 6-8 for each grid point until all grid points within the operational bounds have been visited and seeded.

10. After all grid points have been visited, the task is complete. Inform the user that the planting task is finished.
