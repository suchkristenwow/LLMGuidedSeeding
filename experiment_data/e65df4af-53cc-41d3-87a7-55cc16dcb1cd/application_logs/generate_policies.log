parsing prompt to get constraints ...
llm_result: Based on the prompt provided, the relevant constraints and goal landmarks can be organized into a dictionary format as follows:

{"pattern": "grid", "pattern_offset": 1, "avoid": ["planted", "conmods"], "seed": "True"}

This dictionary captures the instruction to plant in a 1mx1m grid within the bounded area, while avoiding driving over areas where planting has occurred or any conmods.
results_str:  {"pattern": "grid", "pattern_offset": 1, "avoid": ["planted", "conmods"], "seed": "True"}
constraints:  {'pattern': 'grid', 'pattern_offset': 1, 'avoid': ['planted', 'conmods'], 'seed': True}

Question:  I believe this policy should complete the desired task. What do you think?
1. Begin by checking the robot's current position using the localization system to ensure it is within the plot bounds.
2. If the robot is outside the plot bounds, plan the shortest route possible to enter the bounded area while avoiding obstacles and following safety protocols.
3. Activate the RGB cameras to observe landmarks within the immediate environment.
4. Search for any existing planted areas or conmods (constructions or modules) to avoid driving over them during planting.
5. Identify suitable locations within the plot bounds to start planting seeds in a 1m x 1m grid pattern.
6. Plant seeds in the identified locations while maintaining the specified grid pattern offset of 1 meter.
7. Continuously monitor the robot's movement to ensure it does not drive over any planted areas or conmods, adjusting its path if necessary to avoid these areas.
8. Complete the planting process for the entire plot area following the grid pattern while adhering to the avoidance constraints provided.
9. Once all seeds have been planted, verify that the task has been successfully completed within the specified boundaries and constraints.
Feedback: enhanced verification response:  The following paragraph is feedback from the user on a policy. Based on the following response, does the user approve of this policy? Return "True" if so, and "False" otherwise.
If the user suggests any changes, return False. 

At first, there will be no planted areas. You just need to check for planted areas after you
verifying the policy; this is the llm result: Based on the feedback provided, it seems that the user does not approve of the policy as it is currently stated. There is a cut-off in the feedback provided, and it does not clearly indicate whether the user approves or disapproves of the policy. Therefore, I cannot determine the user's approval based on the given information.
