parsing prompt to get constraints ...
llm_result: Based on the prompt provided, the relevant constraints can be categorized as follows:

{"pattern": "grid", "pattern_offset": 1, "avoid": ["planted", "conmods"], "seed": "True"}

Does this categorization match your expectations for the constraints in the prompt, or would you like any adjustments?
results_str:  {"pattern": "grid", "pattern_offset": 1, "avoid": ["planted", "conmods"], "seed": "True"}
constraints:  {'pattern': 'grid', 'pattern_offset': 1, 'avoid': ['planted', 'conmods'], 'seed': True}
building policy...
Question:  I believe this policy should complete the desired task. What do you think?
1. Check current location using lidar-inertial odometry and GPS to ensure the robot is within the plot bounds.
2. If the robot is outside the plot bounds, plan the shortest route to enter the bounded area while avoiding obstacles.
3. Start by locating any existing planted areas or conmods (concentrated modules) within the plot to avoid planting in those spots.
4. Use RGB cameras to identify suitable locations for planting seeds in a 1mx1m grid pattern within the plot bounds.
5. Begin planting seeds in the identified grid pattern, ensuring to maintain a distance of 1 meter between each seed.
6. Continuously monitor the surroundings using the RGB cameras to avoid driving over any previously planted areas or conmods.
7. If there are any uncertainties in locating suitable planting spots or avoiding obstacles, interface with the human for further direction or context.
8. Repeat the planting process until the entire bounded area has been covered in the 1mx1m grid pattern.
9. Once all seeds have been planted, verify the completion of the task and ensure that the robot remains within the plot bounds.
Feedback: enhanced verification response:  The following paragraph is feedback from the user on a policy. Based on the following response, does the user approve of this policy? Return "True" if so, and "False" otherwise.
