1. Initialize the system to start the task. Check if the robot is within the plot bounds. If not, calculate and follow the shortest path to enter the plot bounds.

2. Once inside the plot bounds, initiate the 'grid' pattern for planting as per the 'pattern_offset' of 1m, taking care to avoid 'planted area' and 'conmods' as mentioned in the 'avoid' section of the constraint dictionary.

3. Begin by moving to the nearest corner of the plot bounds, using the RGB camera and lidar-inertial odometry to navigate and identify landmarks and objects to avoid.

4. Start planting seeds at 1m intervals along the width of the plot area. Each planting location should be stored in the system memory.

5. After the completion of one row, move 1m in the perpendicular direction using lidar-inertial odometry and GPS for accurate positioning.

6. Start planting seeds at 1m intervals along this row, in the opposite direction to the previous row. Each new planting location should be added to the system memory.

7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until the entire plot area has been covered in a 1m x 1m grid pattern.

8. If at any point the robot is unable to find a clear path due to the presence of 'planted areas' or 'conmods', inform the user saying "I am unable to find a clear path due to the presence of planted areas or conmods. Please provide further instructions."

9. Once the task is complete, provide a summary to the user, including the total area covered, number of seeds planted, and any difficulties encountered during the operation. 

10. End the task and switch to standby mode, awaiting further instructions.
