1. Start by checking if the robot is inside the plot bounds using the lidar-inertial odometry and GPS for localization. If the robot is outside the plot bounds, navigate to the nearest point within the bounds using the shortest possible route.

2. Use the RGB cameras to create an initial map of the plot, identifying any existing planted areas and conmods to be avoided.

3. Begin at one corner of the plot, selecting it as the starting point for the grid pattern.

4. From this starting point, calculate the grid positions where seeds need to be planted based on the 1mx1m pattern offset given in the constraints. Ensure that these positions are within the plot bounds.

5. For each calculated grid position:
   - Check the path to this position, ensuring it avoids all areas listed under the 'avoid' key in the constraint dictionary. If a path cannot be found, notify the user and ask for instructions.
   - Once at the position, plant a seed. Add this location to the system's memory list of planted locations.
   - Use the RGB cameras to observe the immediate environment for any new obstacles, updating the map as needed.

6. Continue this process until all grid positions within the plot bounds have been planted.

7. Once all seeds have been planted, notify the user of completion. Provide the user with the list of all planted locations for their records. 

8. Standby for any further instructions from the user.
