Received message: I believe this policy should complete the desired task. What do you think?
1. The robot should first use lidar-inertial odometry and GPS for localization to identify its initial position.
2. If the robot begins outside of the plot bounds, it should plan and execute the shortest route possible to be inside the bounds.
3. Next, the robot should generate a map of the plot using the camera feed and GPS. It should identify any obstacles such as conmods or previously planted areas and mark them in the map.
4. Then, the robot should calculate a grid pattern with 1m x 1m offset over the plot map ensuring it avoids the marked obstacles.
5. The robot should then plan a path following the calculated grid pattern, taking into account the plot bounds and the obstacles.
6. If the robot is unable to plan a path due to an obstacle not defined in the constraints, it should ask the user for more context or direction.
7. Once a path has been planned, the robot should start following the path, planting seeds at every grid intersection point.
8. The robot should maintain a list in the system memory of all the planted locations.
9. As the robot moves and plants, it should continually update the map and recalculate the path to avoid driving over planted areas.
10. This process should continue until the entire grid pattern has been planted.
11. Finally, the robot should confirm the completion of the task and provide a report with the locations of the planted areas and any obstacles encountered.
