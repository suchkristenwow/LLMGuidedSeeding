Policy:  1. Initialize the robot's system and check its current position using lidar-inertial odometry and GPS.

2. Compare the robot's current position with the operational bounds ("plot_bounds"). 

3. If the robot is found outside the plot_bounds, plan the shortest route to enter the plot bounds.

4. Once inside the plot_bounds, enable the robot's RGB cameras to observe landmarks and any potential obstacles such as "conmods" and previously "planted area".

5. If a landmark or obstacle is detected, calculate the robot's trajectory to avoid it while maintaining the given 1mx1m grid pattern.

6. If no landmarks or obstacles are found, the robot can start planting seeds according to the 1mx1m grid pattern. Make sure to record each planted location in the system memory.

7. As the robot progresses through the grid, periodically check for landmarks or obstacles again using the RGB cameras. If any are detected, repeat step 5.

8. Continue this process of observing, avoiding obstacles, and planting seeds until the entire area within the plot bounds has been covered.

9. If a landmark in the 'avoid' list such as "conmods" or "planted area" cannot be located, inform the user by saying, "I can't find {landmark}, where should I look?"

10. After the entire area within the plot bounds has been covered, confirm the completion of the task to the user and provide the list of all planted locations.

11. Shutdown the robot's system.

Feedback: enhanced verification response:  The following paragraph is feedback from the user on a policy. Based on the following response, does the user approve of this policy? Return "True" if so, and "False" otherwise.
If the user suggests any changes, return False.
