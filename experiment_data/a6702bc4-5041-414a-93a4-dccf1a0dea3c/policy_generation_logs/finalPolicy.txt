1. Begin by checking the current location of the robot within the plot bounds using lidar-inertial odometry and GPS.
2. If the robot is not currently inside the plot bounds, plan the shortest route possible to navigate inside the plot bounds while avoiding any obstacles.
3. Once inside the plot bounds, start scanning the environment using the RGB cameras to identify any landmarks that match the constraint dictionary's "goal_lms" attribute, in this case, the goal landmark is not explicitly specified, so we will proceed directly to the planting task.
4. Start planting seeds in a 1mx1m grid pattern within the bounded area. Use the constraint dictionary's "pattern_offset" value of 1.0 to ensure each seed is planted 1 meter apart in both horizontal and vertical directions.
5. While planting seeds, avoid driving over any areas where seeds have already been planted (identified as "planted_seeds" in the constraint dictionary) or any conmods (identified as "conmods" in the constraint dictionary).
6. Continue planting seeds in the grid pattern until the entire bounded area has been covered.
7. Once the planting task is completed, update the system memory to mark the areas where seeds have been planted to avoid driving over them in the future tasks.
