policy:  1. First, check your current location against the plot bounds. If you're outside the plot bounds, calculate the shortest path into the plot and move there.

2. Once inside the plot bounds, initialize a grid pattern with a 1m x 1m spacing. This will serve as your navigation guide for planting seeds.

3. Begin at the first grid point, taking care to avoid any planted areas and conmods.

4. At the grid point, deploy a seed.

5. Record the grid point as a planted area in the system memory.

6. Proceed to the next grid point, again avoiding any planted areas and conmods. If the next grid point is occupied by a conmod, notify the user and ask for direction. 

7. Repeat steps 4-6 until all grid points within the plot bounds have been visited and seeds have been planted where possible.

8. Once all grid points have been visited, double-check system memory to ensure all planting locations have been recorded.

9. After seeding is complete, return to the starting point or a user-defined home base, avoiding any planted areas and conmods on the return journey.

10. Notify the user that the planting task has been completed and provide a report of where seeds were planted, any issues encountered, and the final location of the robot.

Feedback: enhanced verification response:  The following paragraph is feedback from the user on a policy. Based on the following response, does the user approve of this policy? Return "True" if so, and "False" otherwise.
If the user suggests any changes, return False. 
Yes this is good

verifying the policy; this is the llm result: True
Found a valid policy approved by the human!
