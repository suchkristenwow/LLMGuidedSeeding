1. Start by checking the current location of the robot within the plot bounds using the localization system.
2. Begin by identifying the landmarks within the plot that may serve as reference points for planting seeds in a grid pattern.
3. Check for any shrubs or other obstacles that should be avoided while planning the grid pattern.
4. If there are any shrubs in the vicinity, plant seeds at least 1 meter away from them as per the constraints.
5. Based on the grid pattern constraint, start planning the grid layout for planting seeds in a 1m x 1m grid throughout the bounded area.
6. Ensure that the robot does not drive over areas where seeds have already been planted or any conmods (consolidated modules).
7. Utilize the lidar-inertial odometry and GPS systems for accurate navigation and positioning within the plot bounds.
8. Plant seeds systematically in the defined grid pattern, making sure to maintain the specified offset distance between each seed.
9. Continuously monitor the progress of planting seeds and adjust the robot's path as needed to ensure adherence to the grid pattern and avoidance of planted areas.
10. Upon completion of planting seeds in the entire bounded area, confirm that all constraints have been met and report back on the successful execution of the task.
