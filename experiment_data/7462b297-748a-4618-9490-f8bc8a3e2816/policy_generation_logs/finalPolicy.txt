1. Begin by localizing the robot using lidar-inertial odometry and GPS to ensure it is within the plot bounds provided in the "plot_bounds" variable.
2. Start scanning the environment using the RGB cameras to identify any existing landmarks and obstacles, such as shrubs, fences, or other vegetation.
3. Plan the shortest route to move the robot inside the plot bounds if it is currently outside the bounds.
4. Check the constraint dictionary for the task details. In this case, the constraint is to plant in a 1mx1m grid within the bounded area while avoiding driving over already planted seeds or conmods.
5. Start planting seeds in a grid pattern within the plot bounds. Ensure that the planting locations are 1 meter apart from each other in both horizontal and vertical directions.
6. While planting, use the landmark avoidance system to avoid driving over areas where seeds have already been planted or any conmods present in the environment.
7. Continuously scan the surroundings using RGB cameras to detect any changes or obstacles that may affect the planting process.
8. If there are any uncertainties or if a landmark mentioned in the constraint dictionary cannot be located, prompt the user with "I can't find {landmark}, where should I look?" for further guidance.
9. Monitor the progress of planting in the 1mx1m grid pattern and ensure that the robot stays within the plot bounds throughout the task.
10. Once all seeds have been planted in the specified grid pattern and the avoidance constraints have been followed, report the completion of the task to the user.
