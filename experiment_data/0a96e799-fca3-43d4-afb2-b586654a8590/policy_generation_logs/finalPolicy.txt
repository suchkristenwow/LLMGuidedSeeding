1. First, check if the robot is within the defined plot boundaries. If not, plan the shortest route inside the plot boundaries using the lidar-inertial odometry and GPS for localization.

2. Define a 1m x 1m grid pattern within the plot boundaries according to the 'pattern' and 'pattern_offset' from the constraint dictionary.

3. Before starting to move, check the immediate environment for any landmarks to avoid, in this case "conmods" and "planted area", using the robot's RGB cameras.

4. If any of the landmarks from the "avoid" list are detected, plan a path that avoids these objects while maintaining the grid pattern.

5. Start moving along the planned path.

6. If the 'seed' boolean is True, plant seeds at every intersection of the grid. As the robot plants each seed, record the location in the system memory to avoid these areas in the future.

7. Continually check the immediate environment for any "conmods" or "planted area" to avoid.

8. If an unavoidable object is detected on the path, stop and inform the user: "I can't avoid {object}, where should I look?".

9. Take the user's direction and re-plan the path accordingly.

10. Continue this process until the entire grid within the plot boundaries has been covered and seeded.

11. After completing the task, provide a final report to the user including the total number of seeds planted and the coordinates of each planted location.
