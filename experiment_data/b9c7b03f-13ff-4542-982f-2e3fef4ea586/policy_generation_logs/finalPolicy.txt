1. Verify the robot's initial location. If it's outside the plot bounds, identify the shortest route into the bounds and move the robot accordingly. 

2. Observe the surroundings using the RGB camera to recognize the 'planted areas' and 'conmods' that need to be avoided as per the constraint dictionary. 

3. Using lidar-inertial odometry and GPS, maintain a real-time position of the robot within the plot bounds.

4. Start the seeding process following the 'grid' pattern as per the constraint dictionary. 

5. Move the robot to the starting point of the plot, and initiate the planting of seeds. Record the position of the first planted area in the system memory.

6. Using the 'pattern_offset' of 1m from the constraint dictionary, move the robot 1m from the first planted area, following the grid pattern, avoiding 'planted areas' and 'conmods' as per the constraints.

7. Plant the seeds at the new position and add the new planting location to the system memory.

8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 until the robot has covered the entire plot following the 'grid' pattern, ensuring it avoids 'planted areas' and 'conmods'.

9. If at any point the robot is unable to find a clear path due to 'planted areas' or 'conmods', request assistance from the user with the message: "I can't find a clear path, where should I look?"

10. Once the task is completed, confirm completion with the user, and provide them with the list of all planted locations from the system memory. 

11. Standby for further instructions.
