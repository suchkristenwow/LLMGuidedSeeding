llm_result:  1. Begin by locating the "bounded_area" landmark within the plot bounds.
2. If the landmark is not immediately visible, ask the user: "I can't find the bounded area, where should I look?"
3. Once the bounded area is identified, start planning a grid pattern for planting seeds with 1m spacing between each point.
4. Ensure that the robot avoids driving over any previously planted areas or any conmods while navigating the grid.
5. Plant seeds at each point of the grid within the bounded area, maintaining the specified 1m spacing.
6. Continuously monitor the robot's progress to ensure it stays within the plot bounds and adheres to the constraints provided.
7. Complete the grid pattern planting while avoiding the specified areas and landmarks.
8. Notify the user once the task of planting in a 1mx1m grid in the bounded area is successfully completed.
