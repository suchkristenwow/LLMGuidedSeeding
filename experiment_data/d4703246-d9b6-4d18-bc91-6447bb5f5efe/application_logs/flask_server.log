1. Initialize the robot's localization systems to ensure accurate tracking of position within the operational bounds.
2. If the robot is outside the plot bounds, calculate the shortest route to enter the plot bounds.
3. Initialize an empty list in the system memory to store the coordinates of all planted locations.
4. Identify any conmods (containers of modular equipment) within the operational bounds and store their locations.
5. Create a grid pattern with 1m x 1m spacing within the operational bounds using the 'pattern' and 'pattern_offset' variables from the constraint dictionary.
6. Initialize a planting routine, beginning from the first point on the grid. For each point:
     1. Use lidar-inertial odometry and GPS to check the robot's position relative to the current grid point.
     2. Check if the route to the current grid point crosses any previously planted locations or conmods.
     3. If there are obstructions, calculate a detour route to avoid them.
     4. Once at the grid point, execute the planting sequence if the 'seed' boolean is True. 
     5. Save the grid point in the planted locations list.
7. Repeat the planting routine for all points on the grid.
8. If a grid point cannot be reached without crossing a conmod or previously planted area, notify the user: "I can't reach grid point at {coordinates}, please suggest a new route."
9. Once all points on the grid have been visited, or an alternative action has been taken as directed by the user, conclude the task.
