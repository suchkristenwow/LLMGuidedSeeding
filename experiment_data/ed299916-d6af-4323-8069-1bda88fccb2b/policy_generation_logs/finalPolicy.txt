1. First, check the current robot position. If the robot is outside the plot bounds, plan the shortest route to move inside the plot bounds.

2. Now, initiate a loop to start the seeding process. This loop will continue until the entire area within the plot bounds is covered.

3. For each iteration in the loop, utilize the lidar-inertial odometry and GPS to accurately locate the robot's position within the plot bounds.

4. Then, use the RGB camera to identify any objects within the immediate environment. Compare these objects with the 'avoid' list from the constraint dictionary. 

5. If any objects from the 'avoid' list are identified within the immediate environment, plan a path to avoid these objects while still following the 1m x 1m grid pattern.

6. If there are no objects from the 'avoid' list in the immediate environment, proceed to the next step in the grid pattern.

7. Once the robot reaches the next point in the grid pattern, check the system memory to ensure this area has not been previously planted. If it has been planted, return to step 3 to move to the next location.

8. If the area has not been planted, plant a seed at this location. 

9. After planting a seed, record this location in the system memory to ensure it will be avoided in future iterations.

10. Then, return to step 3 to continue the process for the next grid point. 

11. If the robot encounters a landmark in the 'goal_lms' that can't be located in the immediate environment, notify the user by saying, "I can't find {landmark}, where should I look?"

12. Once all the points in the grid pattern within the plot bounds have been covered, the task is complete. Confirm completion of the task and standby for further instructions.

Remember, throughout this process, all actions are done while respecting the operational bounds and avoiding the areas listed in the constraint dictionary.
