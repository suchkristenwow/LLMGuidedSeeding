1. First, check if the robot is inside the plot bounds using the lidar-inertial odometry and GPS localization systems. If not, plan and execute the shortest route possible to enter the plot bounds.

2. Once inside the plot, initialize a list to keep track of all the planted locations, as the constraint dictionary indicates that seeding is set to True.

3. Start by identifying the landmarks to avoid which are 'planted areas' and 'conmods' according to the constraint dictionary.

4. Plan a path for a grid pattern with a 'pattern_offset' of 1 meter, as defined in the constraint dictionary. This should be done such that the robot avoids any identified 'planted areas' and 'conmods'.

5. Before moving to each grid point, use the robot's RGB cameras to check if the next grid point conflicts with any 'planted areas' or 'conmods'. If it does, recalculate the path to avoid these areas.

6. Drive to the planned grid point while avoiding the defined obstacles.

7. Once at the grid point, plant the seed and add the location to the list of planted locations.

8. Repeat steps 5 to 7 for all grid points within the plot bounds.

9. Once all the grid points within the plot bounds have been seeded, review the list of planted locations to ensure all points have been covered.

10. Finally, report completion of the task to the user, providing a summary of the areas seeded.

Remember, at any point if there's an uncertainty or a need for further direction, communicate with the user for more information.
