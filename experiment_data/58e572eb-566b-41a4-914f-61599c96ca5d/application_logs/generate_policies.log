initting the Policy Generator with these arguments:  Namespace(prompt_path='/home/kristen/LLMGuidedSeeding/prompts/ex_query.txt', config_path='/home/kristen/LLMGuidedSeeding/configs/example_config.toml', logging_dir='/home/kristen/LLMGuidedSeeding/experiment_data/58e572eb-566b-41a4-914f-61599c96ca5d/policy_generation_logs', plot_bounds_path='/home/kristen/LLMGuidedSeeding/random_path.csv')
parsing prompt to get constraints ...
llm_result: Based on the prompt provided, the relevant constraints can be formatted into a dictionary as follows:

```python
{
    "goal_lms": ["conmods"],
    "avoid": ["planted"],
    "pattern": "grid",
    "landmark_offset": 1.0,
    "seed": "True"
}
```

This dictionary captures the key constraints for the task of planting seeds in a 1mx1m grid in the bounded area while avoiding driving over the planted seeds or any conmods. The "goal_lms" key specifies the landmarks to avoid (conmods), the "avoid" key indicates what to avoid driving over (planted seeds or conmods), the "pattern" key defines the planting pattern (grid), the "landmark_offset" key sets the distance for planting seeds in the grid, and the "seed" key is set to "True" to indicate that the robot should plant seeds.

If you have any specific requirements or need further clarification on the formatting of the constraints, feel free to ask for more details.

feedback is none!
Question:  I believe this policy should complete the desired task. What do you think?
1. Begin by checking if the robot is currently located inside the plot bounds. If not, plan the shortest route to enter the plot bounds while avoiding any obstacles in the way.

2. Use the RGB cameras to identify the landmarks associated with "conmods" within the robot's immediate environment.

3. If any "conmods" landmarks are not immediately visible, prompt the user with: "I can't find conmods, where should I look?"

4. Once the "conmods" landmarks are identified, plant seeds in a 1m x 1m grid pattern throughout the bounded area. Make sure to maintain a distance of 1m from the "conmods" landmarks while planting.

5. Utilize lidar-inertial odometry and GPS for accurate localization and navigation within the plot bounds.

6. As the robot plants seeds, keep track of the locations to avoid driving over the planted seeds or any "conmods" landmarks.

7. Continuously monitor the robot's progress to ensure that it is following the grid pattern and avoiding previously planted areas and "conmods".

8. Complete the revegetation task by systematically planting seeds in the designated grid pattern while adhering to the constraints provided in the constraint dictionary.
Feedback: enhanced verification response:  The following paragraph is feedback from the user on a policy. Based on the following response, does the user approve of this policy? Return "True" if so, and "False" otherwise.
If the user suggests any changes, return False. 

Yes that's good!
verifying the policy; this is the llm result: True
Found a valid policy approved by the human!
