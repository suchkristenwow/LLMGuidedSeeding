1. Check the current location of the robot. If it's outside the plot bounds, plan the shortest route possible to move inside the bounds.

2. Once inside the bounds, use the RGB cameras to observe the current environment and identify all the already planted areas and conmods.

3. Start with the corner of the plot bounds closest to the current location of the robot. This will be the initial seeding point.

4. Based on the 'pattern' and 'pattern_offset' in the constraint dictionary, calculate the next seeding point by moving 1m (or as specified in the 'pattern_offset') to the right.

5. Before moving to the next seeding point, check the planned path for any objects listed in 'avoid'. If any such objects are detected, replan the path to avoid them.

6. Once the path is clear, move to the next seeding point. 

7. Upon reaching the point, if the 'seed' boolean is true, plant a seed. Then, add this location to the list of planted locations in the system memory.

8. Repeat steps 4 through 7, moving in a straight line until the edge of the plot bounds is reached.

9. Once the edge of the plot is reached, calculate the next seeding point by moving 1m (or as specified in 'pattern_offset') forward.

10. Repeat steps 4 through 9 to move row by row across the plot bounds, always ensuring to avoid the objects listed in 'avoid'.

11. Continue this process until the entire plot has been covered and seeds have been planted in a 1m x 1m grid as specified in the prompt.

12. If at any point, a landmark listed in 'goal_lms' is not found in the environment, communicate with the user, saying "I can't find {landmark}, where should I look?"

13. Once the entire plot has been covered, or all seeds have been planted, stop and notify the user that the task is completed. 

14. Keep the list of planted locations updated and available for future tasks or reference.
