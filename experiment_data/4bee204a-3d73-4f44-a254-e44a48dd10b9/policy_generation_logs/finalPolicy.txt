1. Initialize the current position of the robot as the starting point and create an empty list to keep track of all planted locations.
2. Confirm the robot's current position is within the 'plot_bounds'. If not, calculate the shortest route to enter the 'plot_bounds'.
3. Using the RGB cameras, scan the environment to identify any 'conmods' or previously planted areas that need to be avoided. 
4. Check if the robot is currently in an area that should be avoided, as listed in the 'avoid' key of the constraint_dictionary. If so, replan the route to move away from the avoidable area.
5. Once inside the plot and not in an avoidable area, use the 'pattern', 'pattern_offset', and 'seed' values from the constraint_dictionary to guide the planting process.
6. Based on the 'grid' pattern, calculate the next planting location maintaining a distance of 1m (given by 'pattern_offset') from the current location in both the x and y directions. 
7. Move to the calculated location, ensuring to avoid any 'conmods' or previously planted areas.
8. Once reached, if 'seed' is true, plant a seed at this location and add this location to the list of planted locations.
9. Continue steps 6-8, moving in a 'grid' pattern across the 'plot_bounds', until the entire plot has been covered. 
10. If the robot encounters a 'conmod' or previously planted area which is not avoidable while following the 'grid' pattern, notify the user and request for additional instructions.
11. Once all points on the grid within the 'plot_bounds' have been planted, stop the robot and save the list of all planted locations for future reference. Notify the user that the task has been completed.
12. Maintain the robot's readiness for any additional tasks or instructions from the user.
