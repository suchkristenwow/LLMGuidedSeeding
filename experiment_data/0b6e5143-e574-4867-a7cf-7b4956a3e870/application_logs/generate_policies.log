parsing prompt to get constraints ...
llm_result: To parse the prompt into the dictionary format, I would need to ask the following question: 

"Should the robot plant seeds in a specific pattern, such as a grid, within the bounded area while avoiding driving over the planted seeds or any landmarks represented by 'conmods'?"

Based on the prompt, the dictionary format would be:

{
    "pattern": "grid",
    "goal_lms": "conmods",
    "landmark_offset": 1.0,
    "seed": "True",
    "avoid": "True"
}
results_str:  {
    "pattern": "grid",
    "goal_lms": "conmods",
    "landmark_offset": 1.0,
    "seed": "True",
    "avoid": "True"
}
constraints:  {'pattern': 'grid', 'goal_lms': 'conmods', 'landmark_offset': 1.0, 'seed': True, 'avoid': 'True'}

Question:  I believe this policy should complete the desired task. What do you think?
1. Begin by checking if the robot is currently inside the plot bounds. If not, plan the shortest route possible to get inside the plot bounds while avoiding any obstacles.

2. Locate the "conmods" landmark in the immediate environment. If you can't find it, ask the user for guidance: "I can't find conmods, where should I look?"

3. Start planting seeds in a 1m x 1m grid pattern within the plot bounds, making sure to maintain a distance of 1.0m away from the "conmods" landmark.

4. As you plant seeds, avoid driving over the areas where you've already planted seeds or where the "conmods" landmark is located. Use the RGB cameras and lidar data to navigate and ensure you are planting in the designated grid pattern.

5. Continue planting seeds in the grid pattern until the entire bounded area has been covered, ensuring that the robot stays within the plot bounds and follows the specified constraints throughout the task.
Feedback: enhanced verification response:  The following paragraph is feedback from the user on a policy. Based on the following response, does the user approve of this policy? Return "True" if so, and "False" otherwise.
If the user suggests any changes, return False. 

make sure to add a step to update a list of planted locations to make sure you dont drive over them later

Add a part to step 4 that includes updating the system memory with each location where you have seeded.

Question:  I believe this policy should complete the desired task. What do you think?
Certainly! Here is the updated policy based on the user feedback:

Policy:
Step 4: After seeding in each location, update the system memory with details of the location where you have seeded. This information should include the date, time, and any other relevant details for tracking purposes.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need any further assistance.
Feedback: enhanced verification response:  The following paragraph is feedback from the user on a policy. Based on the following response, does the user approve of this policy? Return "True" if so, and "False" otherwise.
If the user suggests any changes, return False. 

Can you write out all the steps of the final policy?
verifying the policy; this is the llm result: I appreciate your feedback. To clarify, you're requesting a detailed outline of all the steps included in the final policy. I will need more information to provide the exact steps of the policy. If you could please provide me with the specific details or requirements of the policy, I can certainly help outline all the necessary steps. Let me know how you would like to proceed.
