I dont know what conmods is. Ill have to ask.

policy:  1. Check the current location of the robot to determine if it's within the plot bounds. If not, plan the shortest route to the nearest point within the bounds and move to this location.

2. If the robot is already within the plot bounds, start the task by identifying the location of the 'conmods' and 'planted areas' landmarks in the plot. If any of these landmarks are not immediately identifiable, ask the user for more information: "I can't find {landmark}, where should I look?"

3. Once all landmarks are identified and mapped, create a grid pattern with a 1m offset. This grid should be designed to avoid 'conmods' and any already 'planted areas'. 

4. Begin at the closest grid point that is not blocked by a 'conmod' or a 'planted area'. Plant the seed at this grid point, then record the location of this newly planted area in the system memory.

5. From the initial planting location, calculate the path to the next closest unblocked grid point using the shortest route. This path should avoid 'conmods' and 'planted areas'. 

6. Move to the next grid point following the calculated path and plant another seed. Again, record the location of this newly planted area in the system memory. 

7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until all viable grid points within the plot bounds have been planted.

8. Once all viable grid points have been planted, return to the starting location by calculating the shortest path that avoids 'conmods' and 'planted areas'.

9. Inform the user that the task has been completed and provide a summary of the completed task, including the number of seeds planted and their locations.

Feedback: enhanced verification response:  The following paragraph is feedback from the user on a policy. Based on the following response, does the user approve of this policy? Return "True" if so, and "False" otherwise.
If the user suggests any changes, return False.
