parsing prompt to get constraints ...
llm_result: The constraints for the given prompt could be categorized as follows:

{"pattern": "grid", "pattern_offset": 1, "avoid": ["planted area", "conmods"], "seed": "True"}

Does this format accurately capture the constraints provided in the prompt?
results_str:  {"pattern": "grid", "pattern_offset": 1, "avoid": ["planted area", "conmods"], "seed": "True"}
constraints:  {'pattern': 'grid', 'pattern_offset': 1, 'avoid': ['planted area', 'conmods'], 'seed': True}

Question:  I believe this policy should complete the desired task. What do you think?
1. Start by checking the current location of the robot within the plot bounds using the localization system (lidar-inertial odometry and GPS).
2. Begin scanning the immediate environment using the RGB cameras to identify any existing planted areas or conmods (constraints to avoid).
3. If there are no planted areas or conmods detected in the vicinity, proceed to the next step. If any are found, mark those areas as no-go zones for planting.
4. Locate the nearest landmark within the plot bounds that matches the "goal_lms" constraint, in this case, the goal is to plant in a 1mx1m grid.
5. If the landmark matching the "goal_lms" constraint is not immediately visible, ask the user for guidance by stating: "I can't find a suitable landmark for planting, where should I look?"
6. Once the landmark is identified, calculate the optimal grid points within the plot bounds to plant seeds in a 1mx1m grid pattern while avoiding the previously marked no-go zones.
7. Start planting seeds at the calculated grid points, ensuring that the robot does not drive over any planted areas or conmods as per the constraints provided.
8. Continue planting seeds in the 1mx1m grid pattern until the entire bounded area has been covered.
9. Monitor the progress and adjust the planting strategy if any new obstacles or constraints are detected during the operation.
10. Upon completion, confirm with the user that the task has been successfully executed, and await further instructions or tasks.
Feedback: enhanced verification response:  The following paragraph is feedback from the user on a policy. Based on the following response, does the user approve of this policy? Return "True" if so, and "False" otherwise.
If the user suggests any changes, return False. 

At first there won't be any planted areas. You just need to update the system memory with the planted locations each time you plant such that you can avoid them. Also, in this case there are no goal landmarks so you can remove step 5.

Question:  I believe this policy should complete the desired task. What do you think?
Updated Policy: The system memory should be updated with the planted locations each time you plant to avoid overlap. The policy no longer includes step 5 regarding goal landmarks as they are not relevant in this case.
