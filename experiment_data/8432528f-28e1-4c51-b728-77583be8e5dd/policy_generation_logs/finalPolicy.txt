1. Confirm the robot is within the plot bounds. If not, plan the shortest route to the nearest point inside the plot bounds.

2. Analyze the RGB camera data to recognize landmarks within the environment, focusing on any identified in the 'avoid' list, in this case, 'previously planted areas' and 'conmods'.

3. Use the LIDAR-inertial odometry and GPS to determine the robot's precise location and orientation within the plot.

4. Begin to construct a navigational plan to move in a 1m x 1m grid pattern as specified in the 'pattern' and 'pattern_offset' fields in the constraint dictionary.

5. As part of this plan, ensure that the robot avoids driving over areas identified in the 'avoid' list by incorporating these into the navigational plan.

6. Before moving, cross-reference the navigational plan with the GPS, LIDAR-inertial odometry, and RGB camera data to ensure the path is clear and avoids the specified areas.

7. If the path is clear, proceed to the first point in the grid pattern within the plot bounds.

8. At each grid point, if the 'seed' boolean is True, plant a seed. Record the GPS coordinates of the planted location in system memory to keep track of all the planted locations.

9. After planting a seed, plan the route to the next point in the grid, again ensuring the route does not pass over any 'avoid' areas and previously planted locations.

10. Repeat steps 7-9 until the entire grid within the plot bounds has been covered and seeds have been planted at each grid point.

11. Once all seeds have been planted, store the completed task and all planted locations in system memory for future reference.

12. If at any point, a path cannot be plotted due to the presence of an 'avoid' object, inform the user with a message such as, "I can't find a path due to the presence of {landmark}, where should I look?"

13. If instructed by the user to replan the path, go back to step 4. If no instruction is given, hold the position and await further instruction.
