1. Validate the initial position of the robot. If the robot is outside the plot bounds, calculate the shortest route to enter the plot and move to that location. 
2. Once inside the bounds, use the RGB cameras to locate any existing "planted areas" or "conmods" to avoid. 
3. Create a dynamic map in the system memory to track these locations and avoid them during the planting process. 
4. Start at one corner of the plot, which will be your initial position, and plan your grid-based route. The grid should have cells of 1m x 1m according to the 'pattern_offset' in the constraints. 
5. Move to the first grid cell location while avoiding any identified obstacles.
6. Upon arrival, plant a seed at the center of the grid cell. 
7. Record the planted location in the system memory. 
8. Proceed to the next grid cell following the planned route. 
9. Repeat steps 5 to 8 for each grid cell within the plot bounds until the entire area is covered. Make sure to avoid all obstacles and previously planted areas as defined in the constraints.
10. Once all the cells within the plot bounds have been planted, confirm completion of the task.
11. Report back to the user the number of seeds planted and their locations. 

Please note that if the robot cannot find a path to a specific grid cell due to obstacles, it will skip that cell and move to the next one. In such a case, the robot will report back to the user about any grid cells that were not planted due to obstructions.
