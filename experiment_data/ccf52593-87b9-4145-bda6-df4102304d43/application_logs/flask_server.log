1. Begin by evaluating the initial location of the robot in relation to the operational bounds ("plot_bounds"). If the robot is outside the plot bounds, plan the shortest route possible to move inside the bounds.

2. After reaching inside the plot bounds, use the RGB camera to identify any existing conmods or planted areas within the plot. Mark these areas as 'avoid' in the system memory.

3. Start scanning the plot area for a suitable starting point to begin the planting task. The starting point should adhere to the constraints given, i.e., it should be at least 1 meter away from any conmods or planted areas.

4. Once the starting point is identified, plan a grid pattern within the plot bounds, making sure each grid cell is 1mx1m as per the given "pattern_offset". Each intersection point of the grid will be a potential planting spot.

5. Navigate the robot to the first intersection point of the planned grid. While navigating, use the robot's localization features to make sure it's not driving over any marked 'avoid' areas. If an 'avoid' area is found on the route, re-plan the route to bypass it.

6. At the intersection point, if the "seed" boolean is True, activate the seeding mechanism to plant the seeds.

7. After seeding, save the coordinates of the planted location in the system memory.

8. Move to the next intersection point in the grid, ensuring not to drive over any 'avoid' areas or the freshly planted spot.

9. Repeat steps 6 through 8 until all intersection points in the planned grid are covered and seeded.

10. If there are any obstacles or 'avoid' areas in the path that are hindering the completion of the grid pattern, inform the user and request further instructions.

11. Once all the grid points have been planted, confirm the completion of the task to the user. Also, share the list of all planted locations for future reference.
