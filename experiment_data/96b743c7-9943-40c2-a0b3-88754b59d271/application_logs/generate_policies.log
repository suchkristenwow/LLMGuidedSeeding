Question:  I believe this policy should complete the desired task. What do you think?
1. First, confirm the current location of the robot. If it is outside the plot bounds, plan the shortest route inside the plot bounds.

2. Once inside the plot bounds, start with the task of planting in a grid pattern. The grid pattern offset is 1m as given in the constraint dictionary.

3. Identify the 'previously planted area' and 'conmods' as landmarks to avoid. 

4. Activate the robot's RGB cameras and GPS systems to observe the landmarks and the plot. 

5. Start from one corner of the plot. 

6. Plant the first seed in that corner.

7. Move 1m horizontally (or vertically) from the current position, according to the grid pattern and plant the next seed. Be sure to avoid 'previously planted area' and 'conmods'. 

8. Repeat this process, moving in a grid pattern and planting seeds every 1m, until reaching the end of the plot. If there's any obstacle identified by the camera or lidar, plan a route to avoid it and continue the grid pattern on the other side.

9. Once one row is completed, move vertically (or horizontally) 1m from the end point of the first row and start the second row. 

10. Repeat the process for each row until the entire plot is covered in a grid pattern.

11. If at any point the robot cannot locate the 'previously planted area' or 'conmods', ask the human for assistance by stating "I can't find {landmark}, where should I look?" 

12. After planting in the whole plot, confirm the task completion to the human and return to the start point or exit the plot as per further instructions.

Note: If at any point, the robot identifies it is about to cross the plot bounds, it should stop, re-evaluate its path and continue within the plot bounds.
Feedback: enhanced verification response:  The following paragraph is feedback from the user on a policy. Based on the following response, does the user approve of this policy? Return "True" if so, and "False" otherwise.
If the user suggests any changes, return False. 

Remove step 11 and at first, there won't be any planted areas to avoid so you can remove that part from step 3. Finally, you should add a step that updates the system memory with the locations you've planted in as to avoid them as you continue.

this is the new prompt:  Given the following policy and user feedback, which steps, if any, were correct? 
Policy: *INSERT_POLICY* 
Feedback: Remove step 11 and at first, there won't be any planted areas to avoid so you can remove that part from step 3. Finally, you should add a step that updates the system memory with the locations you've planted in as to avoid them as you continue. 

modifying policy...
good_steps:  Without the specific policy and the steps associated with it, I'm unable to accurately determine which steps were correct. I need more context or details to provide a precise response. However, according to the user feedback given, changes are required in steps 3 and 11 and a new step should be added for updating the system memory with the locations of planted areas.
