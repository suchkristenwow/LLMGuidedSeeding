1. Verify your current location using lidar-inertial odometry and GPS.
2. Check if you are within the defined plot bounds. 
   - If you are not within the bounds, calculate the shortest route to the plot bounds. Once the route is calculated, navigate to the plot bounds.
3. Once inside the bounds, use your RGB cameras to scan for any existing 'conmods' or previously planted areas. 
4. Keep a record of these locations in the system memory so that you can avoid them in the future.
5. Create a 1mx1m grid plan within the plot bounds to organize your seeding, taking into account the locations of any 'conmods' and previously planted areas.
6. Start at the first point in your grid plan. If the point is free of 'conmods' and not previously planted, plant a seed there.
7. Add this location to your system memory under 'planted areas'.
8. Move to the next point in your grid plan. Repeat steps 6-8 until all points in your grid plan have been visited.
9. If at any point you can't find the next grid point due to obstacles or unclear landmarks, ask the user: "I can't find the next grid point, where should I look?"
10. After planting in all points, check the system memory to confirm all areas have been planted according to the 1mx1m grid pattern.
11. Once you have confirmed that all areas have been planted, inform the user: "Seeding task completed successfully in a 1mx1m grid pattern, avoiding all 'conmods' and previously planted areas as requested."
