Received message: I believe this policy should complete the desired task. What do you think?
1. Begin by checking the robot's current location against the operational bounds, if the robot is outside of the bounds, plan the shortest route possible to be inside the bounds.
2. Once inside the bounds, start by scanning the environment using RGB cameras for any existing planted areas or conmods.
3. If any of the objects listed in the 'avoid' key are detected, mark their location in system memory and plan paths accordingly to avoid them.
4. Begin the grid pattern from one corner of the plot, maintaining a 1m x 1m spacing as defined in 'pattern_offset'.
5. Start planting seeds at each grid intersection.
6. After planting each seed, mark the location in system memory as a planted area.
7. Move to the next grid point, avoiding all marked objects and areas.
8. If the robot encounters an object that it cannot identify or locate, interface with the human for more direction, saying "I can't find {landmark}, where should I look?"
9. Continue this process until the entire plot has been covered, always checking the planned path against the stored locations of planted areas and conmods to avoid them.
10. Once the entire plot has been covered and all seeds planted, store the final map of planted locations in system memory for future reference.
11. Communicate to the user that the task has been completed and provide a report of the activity including the map of planted locations.
