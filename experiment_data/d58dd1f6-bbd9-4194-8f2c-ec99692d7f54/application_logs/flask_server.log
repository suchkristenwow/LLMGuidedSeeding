1. First, check the current position of the robot in relation to the plot bounds. If the robot is outside the bounds, plan the shortest route to the nearest point within the plot bounds and navigate there. 

2. Initialize a list, "planted_locations", to keep track of all the places where the robot has planted seeds.

3. Start by identifying the locations of any conmods or previously planted areas within the plot bounds using the robot's RGB cameras. Store these locations in a list called "avoid_locations". 

4. Begin planning a grid pattern within the plot bounds, taking into account the "pattern_offset" of 1 meter. Make sure to exclude the areas in the "avoid_locations" list from your grid plan.

5. For each grid point in the planned pattern, do the following:

    a. If the grid point is within an avoid location, skip to the next point in the grid. 

    b. Navigate to the grid point using lidar-inertial odometry and GPS for precise localization. 

    c. Once the robot reaches the grid point, use the robotic arm to plant the seed. 

    d. Add this location to the "planted_locations" list.

6. Repeat step 5 until all the grid points in the pattern have been covered.

7. If the robot can't find any grid point within the plot bounds, inform the user by saying "I've covered all available grid points within the plot bounds. Where should I look next?"

8. After all the seeds have been planted, save the "planted_locations" list in the system memory for future reference.

9. Confirm the completion of the task to the user, stating "Task complete: I have successfully planted in a 1mx1m grid while avoiding conmods and previously planted areas."
