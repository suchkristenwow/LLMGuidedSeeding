1. Start by checking the current location of the robot within the plot bounds using lidar-inertial odometry and GPS.
2. If the robot is not within the plot bounds, plan the shortest route to get inside the bounds while avoiding obstacles.
3. Begin scanning the environment using RGB cameras to identify any existing shrubs or landmarks that need to be avoided or considered for planting.
4. Look for any planted areas or conmods to avoid driving over them, as specified in the constraints.
5. Identify suitable locations for planting seeds in a 1m x 1m grid pattern while maintaining the specified offset of 1.0 meters between each seed.
6. Begin planting seeds in the identified grid pattern, making sure to avoid areas where seeds have already been planted or any conmods.
7. Continuously monitor the surroundings to ensure the robot is staying within the plot bounds and following the grid pattern for planting.
8. If there is uncertainty about locating any specific landmark or landmark type mentioned in the constraints, prompt the user for guidance: "I can't find {landmark}, where should I look?"
9. Complete the planting process in the grid pattern while adhering to the constraints provided and maintaining awareness of the surroundings to prevent collisions or overlap.
