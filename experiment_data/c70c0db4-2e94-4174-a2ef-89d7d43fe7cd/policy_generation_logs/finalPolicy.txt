1. Initialize the following:
   - A list to record the positions where seeds have been planted.
   - The robot's current position and orientation based on the GPS and lidar-inertial odometry.

2. Check the robot's current location with respect to the plot bounds.
   - If the robot is outside of the plot bounds, plan the shortest path to enter the plot bounds.

3. Once inside the plot bounds, begin the task execution:
   - Calculate the grid points within the plot bounds considering a 1mx1m grid size and the provided pattern_offset.

4. For each grid point:
   - Evaluate the path to the grid point while avoiding previously planted areas and any detected conmods.
   - If the path is safe, navigate to the grid point.

5. Upon reaching a grid point:
   - Use the RGB camera to verify that no seeds have been previously planted in the immediate vicinity.
   - If the area is clear, proceed to plant a seed.
   - Record the planting location in the list of planted locations.

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each grid point within the plot bounds until all points have been serviced.

7. After planting in the entire grid, save the list of planted locations in the system memory for future reference.

8. Upon completion of the task, notify the user with a message: "Task completed. The seeds have been planted in a 1mx1m grid pattern within the bounded area, avoiding all conmods and previously planted areas."

9. Return to the starting position or a designated home base while avoiding planted areas and conmods.

Note: If at any point during navigation the robot cannot find a safe path due to obstacles, alert the user with a message: "I am unable to find a safe path due to obstacles. Please provide further instructions."
