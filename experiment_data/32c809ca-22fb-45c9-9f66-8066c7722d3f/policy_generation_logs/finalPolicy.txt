1. First, check the current location of the robot. If it is outside of the plot bounds, plan the shortest route to enter the bounds, avoiding any conmods and previously planted areas. 

2. Once inside the plot bounds, initiate the mapping function to create a grid pattern of 1mx1m inside the plot bounds. This will serve as the navigation guide for the robot during the planting process.

3. For each grid cell in the created pattern, check if there is a conmod or a previously planted area within it. If there is, mark this cell as 'avoid' and proceed to the next one. 

4. If the grid cell is free of any obstacles, navigate the robot to the center of the cell, always making sure to avoid any conmods or previously planted areas in the process.

5. Once the robot is in the center of a grid cell, initiate the seeding process to plant a seed in the current location.

6. After successfully planting a seed, store this location in the system memory as a planted location.

7. Move to the next grid cell following the same process as outlined in steps 3 to 6.

8. Continue this process until all the grid cells within the plot bounds have been covered.

9. If at any point the robot can't find a clear path to the next grid cell due to obstacles, inform the user: "I can't find a clear path to the next grid cell, where should I look?"

10. Once all the grid cells have been covered, send a notification to the user indicating that the task has been completed successfully. Also, provide a list of all the planted locations for the user's reference. 

Remember to always keep track of the robot's current location and continually update its status in the system memory. The robot should always remain within the plot bounds during the whole process.
