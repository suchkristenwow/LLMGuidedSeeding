llm_result: To format the constraints of the prompt into a dictionary, we can categorize them as follows:

{"goal_lms": "conmods", "avoid": "True", "pattern": "grid", "landmark_offset": 1.0, "seed": "True"}

This dictionary captures the constraints provided in the prompt:
- "goal_lms": The robot should aim to avoid driving over conmods.
- "avoid": True, indicating that the robot should avoid the specified landmarks.
- "pattern": The planting pattern should be in a grid.
- "landmark_offset": The distance from the landmarks should be 1.0 meters.
- "seed": The robot should plant seeds as specified in the pattern.

llm_result:  1. Determine the starting position of the robot within the plot bounds using localization data from lidar-inertial odometry and GPS.
2. Scan the immediate environment using RGB cameras to identify any existing landmarks or objects to avoid, such as previously planted seeds or conmods (consolidated material). 
3. If there are no landmarks or objects identified in the immediate environment, proceed to step 5. Otherwise, adjust the starting position to avoid driving over them.
4. If there are landmarks or objects in the way, ask the user for guidance: "I've detected objects in the way, how should I navigate around them?"
5. Begin planting seeds in a 1mx1m grid pattern within the plot bounds, ensuring to maintain a distance of 1.0 meters from any identified conmods or previously planted seeds.
6. Move the robot systematically across the plot, planting seeds at each grid intersection while avoiding areas where seeds have already been planted or where conmods are present.
7. Continuously monitor the robot's progress and adjust its trajectory as needed to stay within the bounds and adhere to the planting grid pattern and avoidance constraints.
8. Once all designated areas within the plot have been planted, confirm with the user that the task has been completed successfully: "All seeds have been planted in the 1mx1m grid while avoiding conmods. Is there anything else you would like me to do?"
