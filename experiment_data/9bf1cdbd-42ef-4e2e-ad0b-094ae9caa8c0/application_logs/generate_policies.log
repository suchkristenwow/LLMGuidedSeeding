parsing prompt to get constraints ...
llm_result: Based on the provided prompt, the constraints can be categorized as follows:

{"pattern": "grid", "pattern_offset": 1, "avoid": ["planted", "conmods"], "seed": "True"}

This dictionary format captures the key elements of the prompt:
- "pattern": specifies planting in a grid pattern
- "pattern_offset": indicates the spacing between plantings as 1 meter
- "avoid": lists the objects to avoid driving over, which includes areas where plants have been placed and any conmods
- "seed": set to "True" indicating that the robot should plant in the specified pattern
results_str:  {"pattern": "grid", "pattern_offset": 1, "avoid": ["planted", "conmods"], "seed": "True"}
constraints:  {'pattern': 'grid', 'pattern_offset': 1, 'avoid': ['planted', 'conmods'], 'seed': True}

feedback is none!
Question:  I believe this policy should complete the desired task. What do you think?
1. Begin by checking the current location of the robot using lidar-inertial odometry and GPS to ensure it is within the plot bounds.
2. If the robot is outside the plot bounds, plan the shortest route to enter the bounded area while avoiding obstacles.
3. Use the RGB cameras to scan the immediate environment for any shrubs, fences, or other landmarks specified in the constraint dictionary.
4. Start planting seeds in a grid pattern within the bounded area. The grid spacing should be 1 meter by 1 meter as specified in the constraints.
5. While planting, make sure to avoid driving over areas where seeds have already been planted or any conmods (constructed modules).
6. Continuously update the robot's position using lidar-inertial odometry to ensure accurate placement of seeds in the grid pattern.
7. If there are any uncertainties or if a specified landmark is not immediately visible, prompt the user for guidance by stating, "I can't find {landmark}, where should I look?"
8. Once the grid pattern is completed, verify that all planting has been done correctly and that the robot remains within the plot bounds.
9. Confirm that the task has been completed successfully and await further instructions or tasks.
Feedback: enhanced verification response:  The following paragraph is feedback from the user on a policy. Based on the following response, does the user approve of this policy? Return "True" if so, and "False" otherwise.
If the user suggests any changes, return False. 

You can remove step 7 and also, be sure to update the system memory each time you plant with the location of the seed to ensure you avoid driving over them 
verifying the policy; this is the llm result: False
Updating feedback!
building policy...
this is the new prompt:  Given the following policy and user feedback, which steps, if any, were correct? Return an ordered list of integers of the steps that are good as is. 
Policy: *INSERT_POLICY* 
Feedback: You can remove step 7 and also, be sure to update the system memory each time you plant with the location of the seed to ensure you avoid driving over them 

modifying policy...
good_steps:  1. Step 7 should be removed.
2. Update system memory each time you plant with the location of the seed to avoid driving over them.
