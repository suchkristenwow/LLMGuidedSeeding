1. First, the robot should check its initial position in relation to the plot bounds. If it's outside of the bounds, it needs to plan the shortest route to get inside. Use lidar-inertial odometry and GPS for accurate localization.

2. Once inside the plot bounds, the robot should start identifying any landmarks like the 'planted_area' or 'conmods' that need to be avoided. It should do this by using the RGB cameras. 

3. If any of the landmarks in the 'avoid' list are not visible or detectable, the robot should communicate this with the user by saying, "I can't find {landmark}, where should I look?"

4. After identifying the 'avoid' landmarks, the robot should start planning its path. It needs to plot a 1m x 1m grid within the bounds provided, taking into account the locations of 'planted_area' and 'conmods' to avoid them.

5. Now, the robot can start moving along the planned path. As it moves, it should continuously check for any changes in the environment that may require path adjustments (e.g., new 'planted_area' or 'conmods'). 

6. Whenever the robot reaches a grid point, it should plant a seed if the 'seed' boolean is True. 

7. Each time a seed is planted, the robot should add this location to a list in the system memory of all the planted locations. This is crucial for avoiding these areas in the future.

8. The robot continues this process until all points in the grid have been covered. It should always be aware of its location within the plot bounds and never plan to drive outside of them.

9. Finally, when the entire grid has been covered and all seeds planted, the robot should notify the user that the task is complete. It can also provide a final count of seeds planted and the locations for reference. 

10. If any unexpected obstacles or issues arise during the task, the robot should stop and ask the user for further instructions.
