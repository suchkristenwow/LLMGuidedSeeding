1. Begin by checking the robot's current location within the plot bounds. If the robot is outside the bounds, plan the shortest route to get inside the plot bounds.
2. Start by identifying the landmarks in the immediate environment to ensure accurate navigation. If any landmark in the "goal_lms" is not immediately visible, prompt the user for guidance on where to look.
3. Initiate the planting process by determining the starting point for the grid pattern. Ensure that the robot is at least 1 meter away from any obstacles or boundaries within the plot.
4. Implement the grid pattern planting strategy by moving the robot in 1-meter increments along both the x and y axes. Plant seeds at each grid point while maintaining a safe distance from previously planted areas and any conmods as specified in the constraints.
5. Continuously monitor the robot's position and adjust the planting trajectory to ensure adherence to the 1mx1m grid pattern and avoidance of planted areas and conmods.
6. Complete the planting process for the entire plot area following the grid pattern, making sure to cover the entire designated region while respecting the avoidance constraints.
7. Once the planting task is completed, provide a status update to confirm the successful execution of planting in a 1mx1m grid within the plot bounds while avoiding previously planted areas and conmods.
